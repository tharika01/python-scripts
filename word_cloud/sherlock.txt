1 INT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT 1
... recap ...
... into the scene now.
... JOHN, noticing the red dots suddenly buzzing on his
shirt, SHERLOCK, the same ...
Now JIM MORIARTY striding back into the room.
JIM
Sorry, boys, I’m so changeable. It
is a weakness with me, but to be
fair to myself, it is my only
weakness. You can’t be allowed to
continue. You just can’t. I would
try to convince you, but everything
I have to say has already to say
has already crossed your mind.
Sherlock and John - a glance. A nod from John. And Sherlock
turns, levels his gun at Jim.
SHERLOCK
Then possibly my answer has crossed
yours.
And now lowers the gun -
- to point at the piles of explosives.
And we build to the cliffhanger, just as before, the music
building and building, and then ...
The BeeGees! From somewhere, Staying Alive is playing.
John and Sherlock: a world of what??
But Jim just smirks.
He pats his jacket pocket - his phone, we’re hearing the
ringtone.
JIM
Mind if I get that?
SHERLOCK
You have the rest of your life.
Jim grins, pulls out the phone.
JIM
Hello?
(Listens, impatient)
Yes, of course it is, what do you
want?
He rolls his eyes at Sherlock - honestly, some people! But
now his face is changing at what he’s hearing. Now, he’s
interested - alert and cold and fierce.

1.
JIM
Say that again. Say it again, and
understand that if you are lying to
me, I will find you and I will skin
you!
John and Sherlock exchanging a look - what the hell ... ?
Jim, listening, deciding.
JIM
Yes. Yes, of course I am. Wait!
He looks up at his unseen gunmen above, makes a motion - get
out!
On John and Sherlock -
- and all the little red dots are disappearing. From off we
can hear feet footfalls, doors banging, people leaving.
On John, looking up, listening. Are they actually going to
survive.
On Sherlock: doesn’t take his eyes off Jim, doesn’t lower his
gun.
Now Jim is stepping forward to Sherlock.
JIM
Sorry, my dear. Wrong day to die.
SHERLOCK
(Looking to the phone)
Did somebody make you a better
offer.
JIM
Oh, don’t you worry, we’ll find the
right moment. Because we’ve got a
problem to solve together, you and
I. Do you know what it is?
SHERLOCK
I’m fascinated.
JIM
The big one. The best one. The
final problem. And the funny thing
is, I’ve already told you all about
it. You’ll be hearing from me,
Sherlock - but not for a while.
And he turns on his heel and just walks away. Talking on his
phone.
JIM
If you have what you say you have,
I will make you rich. If you don’t,
I will make you into shoes...
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
2.
He’s gone. A moment on Sherlock and John. Sherlock finally
lowers the gun.
They look at each other.
JOHN
What was that?
SHERLOCK
Who was that?
2 INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 2
A woman’s hand, red-fingernailed, is hanging up a phone -
- then reaches for a riding crop lying next to it. As she
heads away, we pan up -
- to see a woman dressed in tight fitting leather. She’s
heading away from us, through an opulent hotel suite. She
carries the riding crop lightly in one hand.
And now she disappears through the open door of what is a
clearly a bedroom.
From off, we hear her voice.
IRENE ADLER
(From off)
Well now. Have you been wicked,
your highness?
And then, in reply, another female voice.
FEMALE VOICE
(From off)
Yes, Miss Adler.
Swish, crack, and on this we
3 THE OPENING TITLES 3
4 EXT. BAKER STREET - MORNING 4
Establisher of the flat, closing in on ...
221b. Over this, we hear typing. The plastic rattle of a
computer keyboard.
5 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - MORNING 5
SHERLOCK and JOHN in their accustomed position across the
table from each other. Breakfast, coffee - Sherlock scanning
and discarding the papers, John typing away on his computer.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
3.
SHERLOCK
What are you typing?
JOHN
Blog.
SHERLOCK
About?
JOHN
Us.
SHERLOCK
You mean me.
JOHN
Why?
SHERLOCK
Well you’re typing a lot.
John gives him a look - the ego of the man! But Sherlock is
already throwing aside his paper, springing up ready for
action.
SHERLOCK
Right then! So what have we got?
(The following sequence is a sort of montage - a few months a
in the life of John and Sherlock at the top of their game.
Fast, fluid, music-driven.)
6 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 6
A TIMID MAN sitting in the client chair, in 221b. (We haven’t
nominated one, but let’s do it - should be facing the boys
armchairs.)
TIMID MAN
My wife seems to be spending a very
long time at the office -
SHERLOCK
(From off)
Boring!
CUT TO:
Same shot, same chair a WOMAN
WOMAN
I think my husband might be having
an affair -
SHERLOCK
(From off)
Yes!
CUT TO:
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
4.
Same shot, same chair, a big beefy creepy guy.
CREEPY GUY
She’s not my real Aunt, she’s been
replaced, I know she has.
(Holds up an urn)
I know human ash!
SHERLOCK
Leave!
WHIP PAN TO:
A MARRIED COUPLE this time. He stands in front of the
fireplace, addressing Sherlock and John - pompous, full of
himself - and she hovers timidly at his shoulder. Sherlock is
pacing boredly.
HUSBAND
... no one should have been able to
empty that bank account, other than
myself and my wife.
SHERLOCK
Then why didn’t you assume it was
your wife?
HUSBAND
Because I have always had total
faith -
SHERLOCK
No, because you knew you emptied it
yourself.
(Prods the man’s
waistband, hair, face in
rapid successions)
Weight-loss! Hair dye! Botox!
Affair!
(Hands a card to the wife)
Lawyer!
WHIP PAN TO:
Back to the client chair. An important looking man, in a
business suit - flanked by two other men in suits.
BUSINESS MAN
... we are prepared to offer any
sum of money you care to name, for
the recovery of these files -
Sherlock walks across the frame -
SHERLOCK
Boring!
The frame wipes with Sherlock’s cross and becomes:
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
5.
A nervy, geeky young man in a sci-fi tee-shirt. He is flanked
by two other geeky teenagers, standing just behind him.
(Positions exactly resembling the business men.)
GEEKY YOUNG MAN
We have this website - it explains
the true meaning of comic books,
cos people miss a lot of the themes
- but then all the comic books
started coming true.
SHERLOCK
(From off)
Oh, interesting.
WHIP PAN TO:
John typing away at his computer, Sherlock looking grumpily
over his shoulder.
SHERLOCK
The Geek Interpreter. What’s that?
JOHN
The title.
SHERLOCK
What does it need a title for?
WHIP PAN TO:
7 INT. BARTS CORRIDOR - DAY 7
SHERLOCK and JOHN heading along the corridor towards us,
SALLY DONOVAN leading the way.
A YOUNG OFFICER passes in the opposite direction.
YOUNG OFFICER
(To John)
Loved The Geek Interpreter.
SALLY DONONVAN
Yeah, that was good one.
8 INT. MORGUE - DAY 8
On a blonde woman, lying dead. Her face is covered in
blotches and spots. SHERLOCK and JOHN doing their
examination. LESTRADE stands a few feet away, waiting for
them to be done.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
6.
SHERLOCK
So people actually read that blog.
JOHN
Where do you think our clients come
from?
SHERLOCK
I have a website ...
JOHN
Where you enumerate 240 different
types of tobacco ash - nobody’s
reading your website.
(Of the corpse)
Okay, mid-thirties, reasonable
condition, dyed blonde hair, no
obvious cause of death - except
these speckles, whatever they are.
WHIP PAN TO:
9 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 9
Again, John typing away, Sherlock reading grumpily over his
shoulder.
SHERLOCK
Oh for God’s sake!
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
The Speckled Blonde!
WHIP PAN TO:
9C INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 9C
Two little girls squeezed together on the client chair.
LITTLE GIRL
They wouldn’t let us see Grandad
when he was dead. Is that cos he’d
gone to heaven?
SHERLOCK
(From off)
People don’t really go to heaven -
they’re taken to a special room and
burned --
JOHN
Sherlock!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
7.
9A INT. BACK STREET - DAY 9A
Another day, another crime scene. LESTRADE leading JOHN and
SHERLOCK along a back alley - at the end there’s a crashed
car, with the boot open, and a dead man’s arm hanging out.
LESTRADE
There was a plane crash near
Dusseldorf yesterday, everyone
dead.
SHERLOCK
Suspected terrorist bomb, we do
watch the news.
JOHN
You said boring and turned over.
Lestrade now standing over the body in the boot.
LESTRADE
According to the flight details,
this man was checked in on board.
Inside his coat ...
(Holding up clear plastic
evidence bags)
... stub of his boarding pass,
napkins from the flight, even one
of their special biscuits. Here’s
his passport stamped in Berlin
airport. This man should have died
in a plane crash in Germany
yesterday. But instead he’s dead in
a car boot in Southwark.
JOHN
Lucky escape.
LESTRADE
Any ideas?
SHERLOCK
Eight so far.
JUMP CUT TO:
Sherlock examining the body - frowning, as he works.
SHERLOCK
Okay four ideas.
JUMP CUT TO:
Sherlock examining the boarding pass. Frown’s getting worse.
SHERLOCK
Maybe two ideas.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
8.
9B INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 9B
SHERLOCK looking over JOHN’s shoulder at the blog again.
SHERLOCK
Don’t mention the unsolved ones!
JOHN
People want to know you’re human.
SHERLOCK
Why?
JOHN
Because they’re interested.
SHERLOCK
No they aren’t. Why are they?
He storms off to his own side of the desk - but John has had
enough. Taps his computer screen.
JOHN
One thousand, eight-hundred and
ninety five.
SHERLOCK
Sorry, what?
JOHN
I reset the counter last night.
This blog had nearly two-thousand
hits in the last eight hours. This
is your living, Sherlock - not 240
different types of tobacco ash!
SHERLOCK
... 243.
John, back to his typing. We pan up his screen to the hit
counter - 1895.
WHIP PAN TO:
10 INT. THEATRE BACK STAGE - NIGHT 10
SHERLOCK and JOHN heading along a back stage corridor -
UNIFORMED POLICE are dashing in the opposite direction, and
our heroes are heading home.
SHERLOCK
So what’s this one? The Bellybutton
Murders?
JOHN
The Navel Treatment?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
9.
SHERLOCK
Eww.
They are heading down a flight of steps to:
CUT TO:
11 INT. STAGE DOOR - NIGHT 11
- SHERLOCK and JOHN emerging into the stage door area. More
POLICEMEN, and LESTRADE. (There’s a COAT RACK here, a row of
coats.)
LESTRADE
Guys, there’s a lot of press
outside.
SHERLOCK
(Heading to the doors)
Well they won’t be interested in
us.
LESTRADE
Yeah, that was before you were an
internet phenomenon. Couple
of them specifically wanted
photographs of you two.
SHERLOCK
Oh, for God’s sake.
Sherlock has gone to the coat rack, taken a couple of hats -
the only two ones there - and now tosses one to John.
SHERLOCK
Cover your face, John, we’ll move
fast.
John is pulling a cap down over his face..
LESTRADE
Still, good for the public image,
big case like this.
SHERLOCK
I’m a private detective. The last
thing I need is a public image.
As he says this, he jams a hat on this heat - and fatefully,
it happens to be a deerstalker. He pulls it down over his
face, and starts pushing through the doors -
- into an explosion of flashbulbs. And the first flash
becomes -
- a newspaper photograph!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
10.
A black a white of deerstalker-ed Sherlock and John heading
out the doors. Pulling out to the headline (NOT front page)
HAT-MAN AND ROBIN, THE WEB DETECTIVES.
Now a series of flashes and we see variants of the same image
from various angles in various pages, always centred on the
deerstalker. Various headlines. SHERLOCK HOLMES - NET
PHENOMENON. SHERLOCK - NET ‘TEC. SHERLOCK AND JOHN - BLOGGER
DETECTIVES.
On the final flash the last one becomes -
12 INT. IRENE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 12
- an actual newspaper lying on a table. We hold on a moment -
- then a hand reaches into shot, a red fingernail traces
Sherlock’s cheekbone for a moment. During this, from off, we
hear the beeps of someone punching a number into a phone. The
phone is now being answered and the hand withdraws.
IRENE ADLER
(From off)
Hello. I think it’s time - don’t
you?
And then something is tossed casually on to the paper - a
riding crop, lying right across Sherlock’s face ...
We fade to black ...
13 EXT. BAKER STREET - EARLY MORNING 13
Establisher of the flat. A beautiful, sunny day. Early
morning sunshine.
14 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - EARLY MORNING 14
Morning light blazing over the deserted sitting room -
panning over details ...
... last night’s pizza boxes, coffee cups, a cluedo board
skewered to the wall with a knife ...
... closing on the kitchen. MRS HUDSON has been trying to
tidy up. She’s now kneeling at the freezer. She’s pulled out
a bag of something of something squelchy and unsavoury.
She peers at it.
MRS HUDSON
Oh dear! Thumbs!
A movement makes her look up. She startles.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
11.
Standing in the living room, a MAN, portly, profoundly
worried. He’s panting, like he’s been running. He looks
frightened, sweaty, at his wits end. This is PHIL.
PHIL
Sorry, the door ... the door was
...
As Mrs. Hudson stares at him, he sways on his feet -
- then crashes headlong to the floor in a dead faint.
A moment, as Mrs Hudson stares at the prone figure. Then she
turns and calls.
MRS HUDSON
Boys! You’ve got another one!
15 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 15
On PHIL now, sitting in client chair (same framing as the
others) looking a bit lost and bewildered.
SHERLOCK
(From off)
Tell us from the start. Don’t be
boring.
And we track super-fast round Phil so that we’re looking at
him in profile and shot becomes -
16 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/PHIL’S CAR - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON) 16
- PHIL sitting at the wheel of his car. The car stationary,
and he’s trying to start it. The engine turns, coughs,
splutters.
CAPTION
10 HOURS PREVIOUSLY.
He’s now getting out of the car, go to the propped-open
bonnet.
He’s parked at side of a country road. Fields fall away all
around - magnificent desolation.
On Phil grimly contemplating the state of his engine. He
glances around him. No one for miles ... except ...
Phil’s POV. In the middle of the rolling fields, standing
with his back to us, is a solitary figure - a HIKER. He’s
some distance away, but we can see that he has a BACKPACK at
his feet and seems to have stopped a moment to admire the
scenery. He stands a few feet from a stream, runs between the
Phil and the Hiker.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
12.
Phil heads back to the driving seat, tries the engine. This
time - bang! The car’s backfired. Phil sighs, starts to climb
out again -
- but stops at something he sees.
Phil’s POV. The HIKER, is now lying flat on his back like
he’s fallen, or been struck down.
Phil frowns - something about the way the man is lying.
PHIL
(Calling over)
Hey! You okay? Excuse me, are you
all right?
No answer. Phil - curious, maybe a little chilled - starts
heading over.
Clone on the HIKER. Lying flat on his back, staring
sightlessly at the sky - a stain spreading on the grass
beneath him, as we dissolve to:
16A EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 16A
The same patch of grass a few hours later. The blood stain
has dried and the body has now been replaced by an outline.
Pulling further back, we see that a tent has been built round
this little area, and D.I. Carter is now ducking out of it.
Wider: uniformed POLICE searching in the grass for a murder
weapon. PHIL’s car is still parked by the side of the road,
where we last saw it and there are several police vehicles
parked around the place.
A YOUNG POLICEMAN is now calling out of a larger police van
which is clearly the centre of operations.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
(Calling to Carter)
Sir! Phone call for you?
22 INT. SCOTLAND YARD/ LESTRADE’S OFFICE - DAY 22
LESTRADE. On his phone, talking. Wearied and business-like -
as if he’s had to make calls like this a few times.
LESTRADE
Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?
23 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 23
(Intercut as required.)
CARTER
Who?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
13.
The SOUND OF A CAR drawing up. Carter glances round - a CAR
is slowing to halt at the side of the road. The YOUNG
POLCEMAN is already heading over to talk to the driver.
LESTRADE
You’re about to meet him. Now it’s
your case, it’s entirely up to you -
this is just friendly advice. Give
Sherlock five minutes on your crime
scene, listen to everything he
says, and as far as possible, try
not to punch him
Carter’s face: what??
24 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 24
JOHN, now leaning against his parked car (the one we saw
arriving) holding a laptop. The YOUNG POLICEMAN who stopped
him turns as CARTER approaches.
POLICEMAN
Sir, this gentlemen says he needs
to talk to you, he said -
CARTER
Yeah, I know. Sherlock Holmes?
JOHN
John Watson. Are you set up for wifi?
25 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 25
The POLICE TEAM we saw earlier, now standing to one side of
the crime scene, like they’ve been cleared out of the way.
They’re watching something in bemusement.
27 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 27
On Sherlock. He’s at the desk, wearing only a bedsheet,
wrapped around him like he’s a Roman consul. Clearly he’s
just got out of bed and not even bothered to get dressed.
JOHN
(From off)
You realise this is a tiny bit
humiliating?
SHERLOCK
Oh, I’m fine. Take me to the
stream.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
14.
28 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 28
On JOHN. He’s holding his LAPTOP open in front of him, screen
outward. On the screen we can see Sherlock in his sheet, on
the sofa in Baker Street, peering at everything John shows
him as he’s now carries him over the to the stream. Skype
Detective! Carter is walking a few paces behind, not quite
believing his eyes.
JOHN
Didn’t really mean for you.
29 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 29
Sherlock at the desk - we now see his laptop open in front of
him. On the screen we can see the POV of the webcam built
into John’s laptop.
SHERLOCK
This is a six out of ten. There’s
no point in me leaving the flat for
anything less than a seven - we
agreed. Now take me back, closer on
the grass.
30 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 30
John, now carrying Sherlock back towards the tent. (We now
intercut between Baker Street and here as required.)
JOHN
When did we agree that?
SHERLOCK
We discussed it yesterday. Stop.
Lower.
John is now lowering the laptop for a closer view of the
grass.
JOHN
I wasn’t even home yesterday. I was
in Dublin.
SHERLOCK
Hardly my fault if you weren’t
listening.
On Sherlock - as the doorbell rings. He glances off.
SHERLOCK
(Yelling off)
Shut up!
JOHN
Do you just keep talking when I’m
away?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
15.
SHERLOCK
I don’t know - are you away often?
Now show me the car.
He swings round to show Phil’s car.
SHERLOCK
And that’s the one that back-fired -
it made a noise, yes?
JOHN
If you’re thinking gunshot, there
wasn’t one. He wasn’t shot, he was
killed by a single blow to the back
of the head from a blunt
instrument. Which then magically
disappeared along with the killer.
This has got to be an eight, at
least.
CARTER
You’ve got two more minutes. And
then I want to know more about the
driver...
SHERLOCK
Oh, forget him, the driver’s an
idiot. Why else would he think he’s
a suspect?
CARTER
I think he’s a suspect.
SHERLOCK
(Sighs)
Take me over.
JOHN
Okay, but there’s a mute button and
I will use it.
He turns the laptop to face Carter.
SHERLOCK
Up a bit. I’m not talking from down
here.
Biting his lip, John raises the laptop to nearly eye-level.
We stay on the laptop screen as Sherlock talks. (Under this,
we start building helicopter noise - not emphasised, but
slowly increasing.)
SHERLOCK
Having driven to a remote location,
and successfully committed a crime
without a single witness, why did
he then phone the police and
consult a detective? Fair play?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
16.
CARTER
Well he’s trying to be clever,
isn’t he? It’s over-confidence.
SHERLOCK
Did you see him? Morbidly
obese, the undisguised halitosis of
single man who lives alone, the
right sleeve of an internet porn
addict, and the breathing pattern
of an untreated heart condition.
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ, and
limited life expectancy - and you
think he’s an audacious criminal
mastermind?
He looks over his shoulder, revealing the driver (Phil)
sitting on the sofa directly behind him, a little troubled
now.
SHERLOCK
Don’t worry, this is just stupid.
PHIL
What did you say? Heart what?
SHERLOCK
(Turning back to the
computer)
Have you looked in the stream yet?
CARTER
What’s in the stream?
SHERLOCK
Go and see.
MRS HUDSON
(From off)
Sherlock?
MRS HUDSON, standing in the doorway - looking a bit nervous.
Behind her, TWO MEN IN DARK SUITS. One of them is PLUMMER.
MRS HUDSON
You weren’t answering your
doorbell...
PLUMMER
(To the other man)
His room’s through the back, get
him some clothes.
SHERLOCK
Who the hell are you??
PLUMMER
Sorry, Mr. Holmes -
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
17.
JOHN
(Protesting from the
computer)
What’s going on? Sherlock, what’s
happening?
Plummer has reached over and shut the laptop, cutting off
John.
PLUMMER
- you’re coming with us.
39 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 39
John, at the laptop, trying to fix the connection.
JOHN
Sorry, he got cut off, I don’t -
YOUNG POLICEMAN
Dr. Watson?
John glances round - the YOUNG POLICEMAN is turning towards
him, phone at his ear. He looks a little bemused.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
It’s for you.
JOHN
Me? Okay.
He puts his hand out for the phone, but the young policeman
shakes his head.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
No, sir. The helicopter.
John follows his look.
A little distance away, a HELICOPTER is landing.
On John’s face: what??
40 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 40
On Sherlock’s CLOTHES being placed in a neat pile in front of
him. Sherlock, still standing, defiant in his bedsheet.
PLUMMER
Please, Mr. Holmes. Where you’re
going, you’ll want to be dressed.
On Sherlock’s eyes - scanning the man.
SHERLOCK VISION: We now see the man through Sherlock’s
personal heads-up display - words floating over different
parts of the man’s body - all this fast.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
18.
Over the jacket - SUIT: £700.
Over the armpit - UNARMED.
Over the hand - MANICURED. OFFICE WORKER. LEFT HANDED.
Over the shoes - INDOOR WORKER
Over the lower part of the trousers - we zoom in super-fast
to see tiny dog hairs, and the words starting popping up:
SMALL DOG. TWO SMALL DOGS. THREE SMALL DOGS.
Sherlock, smiling faintly now.
SHERLOCK
Oh, I know exactly where I’m going.
On this we dissolve to:
41 EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 41
Buckingham Palace, seen from the air, the roar of a
helicopter all around us.
On John, sitting in the helicopter, staring down at their
destination.
No! Can’t be, no!
42 INT. BUCKINGHAM PACE - CORRIDOR - DAY 42
Another of the DARK SUITED MEN is leading JOHN down a vast,
ornate corridor.
On John, looking around. This is impossible, this is
ridiculous.
43 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 43
A pair of double doors are swept open, revealing a huge,
spectacular room, empty, except for ...
... SHERLOCK HOLMES, sitting on an ornate sofa, right in the
middle, still wrapped in a bedsheet and clearly in a towering
sulk.
On JOHN, observing him from the door. The DARK SUITED MAN
ushers him in.
John steps inside, the man withdraws.
A silence as John and Sherlock look at each other. John
spreads his hands - a questioning gesture, what the hell is
going on?
Sherlock: shrugs back. Search me.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
19.
John comes in to the room, sits on the other end of the sofa.
Another silence.
JOHN
... are you wearing pants?
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
Okay.
They look at each other -
- and then both just burst out laughing. Just the joyous
absurdity of it. Where they are, what they’re doing, for
God’s sake!!
Through the laughter:
JOHN
What are we doing here? Sherlock,
seriously, what?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know!
JOHN
Are we here to see the Queen?
The thought almost quells the laughter for a second. And then
the door opens, and MYCROFT steps in.
SHERLOCK
Apparently, yes.
And this childish jokes sets them off again, roaring with
laughter.
Hugely annoyed. Mycroft bangs shut the door.
MYCROFT
Just once, could you two behave
like grown-ups.
JOHN
We solve crimes, I blog about it,
and he forgets his pants - how high
are your standards?
SHERLOCK
I was in the middle of a case,
Mycroft!
MYCROFT
What, the hiker and the back-fire?
I glanced at the police report -
bit obvious, surely.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
20.
SHERLOCK
Transparent.
MYCROFT
Time to move on, then.
Mycroft has picked up Sherlock’s folded clothes from the
chair.
MYCROFT
We are in Buckingham Palace. The
very heart of the British nation.
(Presents the clothes with
mock formality)
Sherlock Holmes - put your trousers
on.
SHERLOCK
What for?
MYCROFT
Your client.
SHERLOCK
And my client is ... ?
A voice from off.
THE EQUERRY
Illustrious.
They look round.
There’s a side door, almost concealed in the ornate wall, and
entering through is a formidable, older man. Probably an exarmy officer, carries a truly frightening air of selfpossession and importance.
THE EQUERRY
In the extreme. And remaining, I
have to inform you, entirely
anonymous. Mycroft!
MYCROFT
(Shaking hands)
Harry. Can I just apologise for the
state of my little brother.
THE EQUERRY
A full time occupation, I imagine.
And this must be Dr. John Watson,
formerly of the Fifth
Northumberland Fusiliers?
JOHN
(Shaking his hand)
Hello, yes
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
21.
THE EQUERRY
My employer is a tremendous fan
your blog.
JOHN
... your employer?
THE EQUERRY
Particularly enjoyed the one about
the aluminium crutch.
(Turning to Sherlock)
And Mr. Holmes, the younger. You
look taller in your photographs.
SHERLOCK
I take the precaution of a good
coat and a short friend.
Mycroft, I don’t do anonymous
clients. I’m used to a mystery at
one end of my cases - both ends is
too much work. Good morning.
He starts to head to the door. Mycroft puts out a foot, and
stands on the trailing end of Sherlock’s sheet, stopping him
in tracks.
MYCROFT
This is a matter of national
importance. Grow up!
SHERLOCK
Get off my sheet.
MYCROFT
Or what?
SHERLOCK
I’ll just walk away.
MYCROFT
I’ll let you.
JOHN
Boys, please, not here.
SHERLOCK
Who is my client?
MYCROFT
Take a look at where you’re
standing and make a deduction - you
are to be engaged by the highest in
the land. Now for Gods sake, put
your clothes on!
44 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 44
A few minutes later. The four of them having TEA. SHERLOCK is
now dressed. MYCROFT is pouring.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
22.
MYCROFT
I’ll be mother.
SHERLOCK
And there’s a whole childhood in a
nutshell.
THE EQUERRY
My employer has a ... problem.
MYCROFT
A matter has come to light of an
extremely delicate, and potentially
criminal nature - and in this hour
of need, dear brother, your name
has arisen.
SHERLOCK
Why? You have a police force - of
sorts. Even a marginally secret
service. Why come to me?
THE EQUERRY
People do come to you for help,
don’t they, Mr. Holmes?
SHERLOCK
Not, to date, anyone with a navy.
MYCROFT
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.
JOHN
You don’t trust your own secret
service?
MYCROFT
Naturally not. They all spy on
people for money.
SHERLOCK
Fair point.
JOHN
But it’s Sherlock you want - what
am I doing here?
THE EQUERRY
I did wonder myself, Mycroft.
MYCROFT
My baby brother is a genius in his
chosen field. But in this case, we
need a genius with a conscience -
which, typically, my brother has
outsourced.
JOHN
Oh, great. I’m Jiminy Cricket.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
23.
The Holmes brothers both laugh - a rare moment of bonding.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
23A.
MYCROFT
Actually, that rather works.
SHERLOCK
It does, doesn’t it?
THE EQUERRY
(Sharply)
I do think we have a timetable.
MYCROFT
Of course, yes.
He has taken an ENVELOPE from his CASE, now slides a
PHOTOGRAPH from it. He passes it to Sherlock.
MYCROFT
What do you know about this woman?
On the photograph - a headshot of a stunningly beautiful
woman. And as we see this we cut to:
45 INT. LIMO - DAY 45
The same WOMAN - IRENE ADLER - but live. She’s sitting the
back of the car, looking boredly, but imperiously, out of the
window. Her phone beeps, she glances at it:
Screen text: I’M SENDING YOU A TREAT.
SHERLOCK
(V.O.)
Nothing whatsoever.
CUT TO:
46 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 46
On SHERLOCK as he now flicks the photo around for JOHN, as
if trying it out on him. John, sipping his tea, almost
misses.
SHERLOCK
- but she’s clearly very
attractive. John, you might want to
dab your shirt front. Who is she?
47 INT. SMART HOUSE IN BELGRAVIA - DAY 47
The LIMO has drawn up at a lovely London town house. The
FEMALE CHAUFFEUR is now walking round to open the rear
door... (We continue hearing the conversation at Buckingham
Palace.)
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
24.
MYCROFT
(V.O.)
Irene Adler. Professionally known
as the Woman.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
24A.
(MORE)
JOHN
(V.O.)
Professionally?
IRENE ADLER now stepping out the car - spectacular in
spectacular heels.
MYCROFT
(V.O.)
There are many names for what she
does - she prefers dominatrix.
Irene, now heading towards the house. She glances at her
phone.
Screen text: PHOTOS DOWNLOADING.
48 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 48
SHERLOCK
Dominatrix?
MYCROFT
Don’t be alarmed. It’s do to with
sex.
SHERLOCK
Sex doesn’t alarm me.
MYCROFT
How would you know? She provides,
you might say, recreational
scolding to those enjoy that sort
of thing, and are prepared to pay
for it.
He’s now passing Sherlock several COLOURFUL PRINTED SHEETS
(clearly a printed-out website.)
MYCROFT
This is all from her website.
On the sheets. A page of material, with the masthead that
reads The Woman. The page prominently illustrated with photos
of IRENE in various kinds of terrifying and sexy fetish gear.
He flicks to the second page -
- but the picture becomes -
CUT TO:
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
25.
MYCROFT (cont'd)
49 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 49
- close on IRENE’s phone -
A photograph, on a long lens of SHERLOCK in Baker Street.
He’s wrapped in the sheet we saw him in earlier, and being
manhandled into the car, by the two dark-suited men. He looks
preposterous and vulnerable.
She flicks to the second photograph -
- but the picture becomes -
CUT TO:
50 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 50
- IRENE in spectacular fetish gear, brandishing a whip,
menacingly -
Sherlock flicks to the next sheet but it becomes -
CUT TO:
51 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 51
IRENE’s phone: closer on SHERLOCK, vulnerable is sheet -
On Irene’s face, looking at his. She smirks, amused
CUT TO:
52 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ROOM - DAY 52
Oh Sherlock’s face. He frowns in distaste, puts the sheets
face down on the table.
SHERLOCK
I assume this Adler woman has some
compromising photographs.
THE EQUERRY
You’re very quick, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom?
THE EQUERRY
A person of significance to my
employer.
SHERLOCK
Family member, friend, distant
relative ... ?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
26.
THE EQUERRY
We prefer not be more specific at
this time.
SHERLOCK
Anonymous client, anonymous victim -
would it help if I investigated
wearing a blindfold?
JOHN
You can’t tell us anything?
MYCROFT
I can tell you, it’s a young
person.
(Hesitates)
A young female person.
SHERLOCK
How many photographs?
MYCROFT
A considerable number, apparently.
SHERLOCK
Do Miss Adler and this young female
person appear in the photographs
together?
MYCROFT
Yes, they do.
SHERLOCK
I assume in a variety of
compromising scenarios.
MYCROFT
An imaginative range, we’re
assured.
A silence. They digest.
SHERLOCK
... John, you probably want to keep
that cup in the saucer now.
John has had the cup frozen half-way to his mouth. He now
delicately sets it down.
THE EQUERRY
It is our opinion that should these
photographs come to light, they
would have a catastrophic effect on
the establishment you see around
you. Can you help us, Mr. Holmes?
SHERLOCK
How?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
27.
THE EQUERRY
Will you take the case?
SHERLOCK
What case? Pay her. Now, and in
full. As Miss Adler remarks on her
masthead - know when you are
beaten.
MYCROFT
She doesn’t want anything.
She got in touch. She informed us
that the photographs existed. She
indicated that she had no intention
to use them to extort either money
or favour.
JOHN
... Then why get in touch at all?
MYCROFT
We don’t know.
On Sherlock - now the ghost of a smile. Intrigued for the
first time.
SHERLOCK
... oh! A power play. A power play
with the most powerful family in
Britain. Now that’s a dominatrix.
Oh this is getting a bit fun now,
isn’t it?
JOHN
Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
Where is she?
MYCROFT
In London, currently. She’s staying
at -
SHERLOCK
Text me the details. I’ll be in
touch by the end of the day.
He’s heading for the door now, John following.
THE EQUERRY
Do you really think you’ll have
news by then?
SHERLOCK
No. I think I’ll have the
photographs.
He turns to sweep out.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
28.
THE EQUERRY
One can only hope you’re as good as
you seem to think.
Just the tiniest flash in Sherlock’s eye. He turns back to
him -
- the barest glimpse: SHERLOCK’s POV, words swirling round
her. (None emphasised, but they include DOG LOVER, HORSE
RIDER, EARLY RISER, LEFT SIDE OF BED, NON-SMOKER, FATHER,
RIGHT-HANDED, KEEN READER, TEA DRINKER.)
SHERLOCK
I’ll need some equipment, of
course.
MYCROFT
Anything you require, I’ll have it
send over.
SHERLOCK
Could I have a box of matches?
- and now holds out a hand, expectantly, to the Equerry.
THE EQUERRY
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
Or your cigarette lighter, either
would do.
THE EQUERRY
I don’t smoke.
SHERLOCK
I know you don’t. But your employer
does.
An impasse of stares -
- then the Equerry reaches into his pocket, produces a
lighter, hands it to Sherlock.
THE EQUERRY
We have kept lot of people
successfully in the dark about this
little fact, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
I’m not the commonwealth.
JOHN
And that’s as modest as he gets.
Pleasure to meet you.
He gives a little bow. Sherlock glances contemptuously at him
- the fawner!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
29.
SHERLOCK
Laters.
He heads out, John following.
54 INT. TAXI - DAY 54
SHERLOCK and JOHN, in the back of the taxi, as it drives away
from BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
JOHN
Okay - the smoking, how did you
know?
SHERLOCK
The evidence was right under your
nose, John - as ever you see, but
you do not observe.
JOHN
Observe what?
He pulls something from his coat, tosses it to John.
SHERLOCK
The ashtray.
He tosses a stolen ashtray to John.
John laughs - and then they’re both sniggering like
schoolboys.
55 EXT. THE MALL - DAY 55
As the car sweeps away from us along the Mall, the picture
clicks and freezes, becoming a photograph on -
56 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 56
- IRENE’s phone.
Wider on Irene. She’s on the edge of her bed, smiling now.
(The bedroom around, as wild and dangerous as you’d expect.)
IRENE ADLER
Kate?
The Chauffeur, now dressed as a MAID.
IRENE ADLER
We’re going to have a visitor. I’ll
need a bit of time to get ready.
KATE
A long time.
Irene smiles - a demonic grin.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
30.
IRENE ADLER
Oh, ages!
We cut to darkness -
- then the screen splits into light as wardrobe doors are
flung open. We are looking Irene through endless rails of
dresses ...
57 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 57
JOHN, standing in the kitchen. He’s looking, a little
impatiently, into the back corridor (where Sherlock’s room
is.)
As we watch, various items of clothing are tossed through
Sherlock’s open door - a SOLDIER’S UNIFORM, WORKMAN’S
OVERALLS - as each is rejected. A TUXEDO joins the pile.
JOHN
What are you doing?
Sherlock appears through the door, with a policeman’s jacket
slung over his normal clothes.
SHERLOCK
I’m going into battle, John. Need
the right armour.
(Looks down at his police
jacket)
Nah!
He disappears back into his room, pulling the jacket off.
58 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 58
IRENE modeling a startling mini-dress in the mirror.
Considers, then -
IRENE ADLER
Nah.
Kate is leaning in the doorway, watching appreciatively.
KATE
Works for me.
IRENE ADLER
Everything works on you.
KATE
Is that bad?
IRENE ADLER
I hope so.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
31.
59 INT. TAXI - DAY 59
JOHN and SHERLOCK in the back of a taxi.
JOHN
So what’s the plan?
SHERLOCK
We know her address.
JOHN
So what do we do. Ring the
doorbell?
SHERLOCK
Exactly.
(Leaning forward, to the
cabbie)
Here please.
JOHN
But you didn’t even change your
clothes.
SHERLOCK
Then it’s time to add a splash of
colour.
60 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 60
IRENE, at her make-up table.
KATE is delicately applying her make-up. Their eyes meet for
a moment - a flirtatious smile...
61 INT. A BACK ALLEY - DAY 61
A back alley - smart, but deserted. JOHN and SHERLOCK heading
towards us. Beyond them, we can see the TAXI leaving from the
end of the alley.
JOHN
Are we here?
SHERLOCK
Couple of streets away. But this
will do.
JOHN
For what?
Sherlock rounds on John.
SHERLOCK
Punch me in the face.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
32.
62 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 62
Kate is holding up a range of lipsticks for IRENE’s approval.
KATE
Shade?
On Irene - that demonic smile again.
IRENE ADLER
Blood.
63 EXT. A BACK ALLEY - DAY 63
SHERLOCK and JOHN in confrontation.
JOHN
Punch you?
SHERLOCK
Yes, punch me. In the face, didn’t
you hear me?
JOHN
I always hear “punch me in the
face” when you’re speaking. But
it’s usually subtext.
SHERLOCK
Oh for God’s sake.
And smartly and efficiently, he just slaps John round the
face. John is whacked right back out of shot -
- and then a beat later comes tearing back into frame, fists
flailing at Sherlock.
64 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 64
Kate, sitting very close, is now applying IRENE’s lipstick.
Their eyes meet again.
65 EXT. A BACK ALLEY - DAY 65
JOHN now has SHERLOCK in a headlock, and the struggle
continues.
SHERLOCK
Okay! I think we’re done now.
JOHN
You want to remember, Sherlock, I
was a soldier! I killed people!
SHERLOCK
You were a doctor!!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
33.
JOHN
I had bad days!!
66 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 66
Kate, applying the finishing touches.
KATE
What are you going to wear?
IRENE ADLER
My battledress.
KATE
Lucky boy.
We hear the doorbell ring.
KATE
Is that him?
IRENE ADLER
Got to be.
KATE
Ringing the doorbell? Does he think
we’ll just let him in?
IRENE ADLER
He must think he’s got a way of
persuading us. Go and see what it
is.
67 INT. HALLWAY OF IRENE’S HOUSE - DAY 67
On Kate, now making her way down the hallway.
She presses the entry phone unit next to the door.
KATE
Hello?
On the little screen, we see SHERLOCK, seeming bent over, as
if injured.
SHERLOCK
(On screen)
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’ve been
attacked - I think they took my
wallet - please could you help me
...
Kate’s face - amused.
KATE
I could phone the police, if you
want.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
34.
SHERLOCK
(On screen)
Yes, please, if you could. Do you
mind if I just wait out here?
On screen, he straightens up slightly -
- reveal that he’s wearing a clerical collar.
On Kate’s face - oh, he’s pretending to be a vicar. A knowing
smirk - which she hides as she starts opening the door -
- to reveal Sherlock, and (to her surprise) John, seemingly
helping him.
JOHN
I saw it happen - It’s okay, I’m a
doctor.
And before she can stop them, they’re through the door.
68 INT. IRENE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 68
A sumptuous, and very respectable, living room. Sherlock,
alone, is perched on the end of a sofa, dabbing at his
bruised face.
We hear a door open behind him.
IRENE ADLER
(From off)
Hello, sorry to hear you’ve been
hurt. I don’t think Kate caught
your name.
Sherlock, getting hurriedly to his feet.
SHERLOCK
Yes, sorry, I’m -
And he breaks off. For the first time ever, we see all the
brakes jam on in his brain as he just stares.
Because IRENE ADLER is standing in front of him, entirely
naked. (NB. This shot for pre-watershed. We know she is naked
but we don’t see anything. Like Sherlock, we always manage to
avert our eyes.)
Irene is just smiling at him now.
IRENE ADLER
Oh it’s always so hard to remember
an alias when you’ve just had a
fright, isn’t
She steps lightly forward, plucks off his clerical collar.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
35.
IRENE ADLER
There now, we’re both defrocked -
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
SHERLOCK
Irene Adler, I presume.
On Sherlock: on the back foot for once. And now she’s running
a finger along one of his cheekbones.
IRENE ADLER
Look at these cheekbones. I think I
could cut my hand slapping your
face. Would you like me to try?
With an impish smile, she pops the clerical collar in her
mouth, snapping her teeth shut on it.
- just as John enters (bowl, towel, the cuts and bruises
paraphernalia you find in any bathroom.)
JOHN
Right then, so ...
And he stops dead at what he sees: Sherlock, fact to face
with a naked woman, who has his clerical collar in her teeth.
JOHN
... okay. Missed something, did I?
Irene just smiles. Without a care in the world, she heads
over to the other sofa, settles down on it. (Perhaps she
picks up a cushion at this point - just to make the scene
shootable.)
IRENE ADLER
Please, sit down. If you’d like
some tea, I’ll call the maid.
SHERLOCK
I had some at the Palace.
IRENE ADLER
I know.
SHERLOCK
Clearly.
Sherlock and Irene, now sitting on opposite - burning the air
between them, with staring.
John, feeling very out of it:
JOHN
... I had a tea at the palace too.
If anyone’s interested.
They clearly aren’t.
On Sherlock - something troubling him.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
36.
Sherlock’s POV. On Irene, just sitting there. As he glances
over to John we see the normal swirl of words round him (TWO
DAY SHIRT. ELECTRIC NOT BLADE. HAD A LARGE CAPPUCINO. DATE
TONIGHT. HASN’T PHONED SISTER. NEW TOOTHBRUSH. NIGHT OUT WITH
STAMFORD.) but when he looks back to Irene -
- nothing.
He blinks.
Nothing.
Blinks again.
Nothing.
IRENE ADLER
(Tosses the dog collar in
her hand)
Do you know the big problem with
disguise, Mr. Holmes? However hard
you try, it’s always a selfportrait.
SHERLOCK
You think I’m a vicar with a
bleeding face?
IRENE ADLER
I think you’re damaged, delusional,
and believe in a higher power -
though in your case, it’s yourself.
And somebody loves you.
On Sherlock - a flicker of confusion.
IRENE ADLER
If I had to punch you in the face
I’d try to avoid your teeth and
your nose too.
Her eyes to flash like lasers to John - who just bridles.
JOHN
Could you put something on, please?
Anything at all - a napkin.
IRENE ADLER
Why - are you feeling exposed?
Sherlock pulls his coat, from where it’s lying on the sofa
next to him. He tosses it over to Irene.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
37.
SHERLOCK
I don’t think John knows where to
look.
Irene, now pulling the coat on.
IRENE ADLER
Oh, I think he knows exactly where.
I’m not sure about you.
SHERLOCK
If I wanted to look at naked women,
I’d borrow his laptop.
JOHN
You do borrow my laptop.
SHERLOCK
I confiscate it.
IRENE ADLER
Never mind all that, we’ve got
better things to talk about. Tell
me, I need to know - how was it
done.
SHERLOCK
.... what?
IRENE ADLER
The hiker with the bashed in head.
How was he killed?
Sherlock and John exchanging a look - what?
SHERLOCK
That’s not why I’m here.
IRENE ADLER
No, you’re here for the
photographs. But you’re never going
to get them, so seeing as we’re
chatting anyway...
On Sherlock - something new here. Something he’s not quite in
control of. But he’s keeping it calm, staying impassive.
JOHN
That story hasn’t even been on the
news. How do you know about it?
IRENE ADLER
I know one of the policemen. Well -
I know what he likes.
JOHN
What, and you like policemen?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
38.
IRENE ADLER
I like detective stories. And
detectives. Brainy - it’s the new
sexy.
SHERLOCK
The position of the car.
John and Irene look at him. What?
SHERLOCK
The position of the car, relative
to the hiker, at the time of the
backfire. That plus the fact that
the death blow was on the back of
his head. All the information you
need.
IRENE ADLER
Okay, tell me. How was he murdered?
SHERLOCK
He wasn’t.
IRENE ADLER
You don’t think it was murder.
SHERLOCK
I know it wasn’t.
IRENE ADLER
How?
SHERLOCK
The same way I know the victim was
an excellent sportsman, recently
returned from foreign travel. And
that the photographs I’m looking
for are in this room.
IRENE ADLER
Okay, but how?
SHERLOCK
(Springing to his feet)
So they are in this room - thank
you! John, outside, man the door,
let no one in.
John is already heading to the door.
As he passes, Sherlock the tiniest look of complicity flashes
between them. They’re up to something, and this is part of
the plan -
On Irene: what’s going on?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
39.
69 INT. HALLWAY OF IRENE’S HOUSE - DAY 69
John emerging from the room, closing the door. Looks around,
then up at the ceiling. Sees what he needs.
Now steps across the hallway, takes a magazine from a table,
rolls it up ...
... and from this jacket he takes the lighter the Equerry
gave Sherlock ...
70 INT. IRENE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 70
Sherlock swanning around the room, in his element now -
explaining!
SHERLOCK
Okay. Two men, alone in
countryside, several yards apart,
and one car...
IRENE ADLER
Oh, I thought you were looking for
the photographs now?
SHERLOCK
Oh, no, looking takes ages! I’m
just going to find them. But we’ve
got a minute, and you’re moderately
clever, so let’s pass the time. Two
men, a car, and nobody else.
71 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 71
Now FLASHBACKING to the earlier scene, but in SHERLOCK
VISION. PHIL is at the wheel of his car, trying to start his
car - he’s in freeze-frame.
SHERLOCK
(V.O.)
The driver’s trying to fix
his engine ...
Now SHERLOCK walks past Phil (in reality, still swanning
about Irene’s room talking to her, but visually now walking
among the flashback.)
SHERLOCK
Getting nowhere.
Whip pan to:
Over at with HIKER, also frozen. He’s standing, seemingly
staring at the sky
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
40.
SHERLOCK
(V.O.)
And the hiker is taking a moment.
Looking at the sky. Watching the
birds?
And SHERLOCK steps from behind FROZEN HIKER. (Again still
really swanning about Irene’s room, but stitched into the
flashback.)
SHERLOCK
Any moment now something’s going to
happen. What?
We cut to Irene, still sitting on the sofa - but now the sofa
is SITTING IN THE THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. Beyond her, we can
see Phil in the car.
IRENE ADLER
The hiker’s going to die.
SHERLOCK
No. That’s the result. What’s going
to happen.
IRENE ADLER
... I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK
Try to.
IRENE ADLER
Why?
SHERLOCK
Because your job is ridiculous.
Because you cater to the whims of
the pathetic and take your clothes
off to make an impression. Stop
boring me and think. It’s the new
sexy.
On Irene - those words landing like slaps. Regroups.
IRENE ADLER
... the car’s going to backfire.
SHERLOCK
There’s going to be loud noise.
IRENE ADLER
So what?
SHERLOCK
Oh, noises are important. Noises
can tell you everything. For
instance -
And the beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. The shrill of smoke alarm.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
41.
Super fast zoom on Sherlock’s eyes. Stylised slow-motion, as
they swivel to look at Irene with a big, slamming sound
effect.
On Irene: stylised slow motion as the turns her to look at -
- big slamming sound effect -
- an ornate mirror on the wall.
SHERLOCK
Thank you!
Sherlock start striding towards the mirror.
SHERLOCK
A mother, hearing a smoke alarm,
would look towards her child ...
He slides the mirror to one side, revealing a safe built into
the wall, with a keypad on it.
SHERLOCK
I really hope you don’t have a baby
in here.
(Calls off)
You can turn it off, John.
72 INT. HALLWAY OF IRENE’S HOUSE - DAY 72
John is standing in the hallway - has the magazine held aloft
like a torch, one end lit and smoking right under a smoke
alarm.
He now beats against the wall, putting it out.
SHERLOCK
(Yelling from)
I said turn it off.
JOHN
Well give me a moment -
And then, from off - a calm American voice -
NEILSON
Excuse me -
John looks round.
Three men standing in the hallway now. Big, black suits,
square-jawed - traditional men in black. NEILSON, Tranter,
ARCHER.
NEILSON
Let me take care of that for you.
And Neilson draws a gun with silence from under his jacket,
aims it at the alarm, and shoots it. It falls silent.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
42.
JOHN
... thanks.
73 INT. IRENE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 73
Sherlock, examining the keypad.
SHERLOCK
You should use a glove on these
things, you know - ever seen the
state of an iPad screen? Now the
heaviest oil deposit is always on
the first key used - that’s clearly
a 3 - but the sequence is almost
impossible to read after that. I
know from the make it’s a six digit
code, and it can’t be your birthday
- no disrespect, but you were
clearly born in the 80s and the
eight is barely used - so -
IRENE ADLER
I’d tell you the code right now -
but you know what?
He looks at her.
IRENE ADLER
I already have.
On Sherlock - frowns. What?
IRENE ADLER
Think!
And now the door is bursting open. John is being shoved into
the room, slammed down to his knees - Archer takes John,
Tranter takes Irene, Neilson walks among them, barking
orders.
NEILSON
Hands behind your head, on the
floor, keep it still!
JOHN
Sorry, Sherlock.
NEILSON
Miss Adler, on the floor!
Archer stays behind John, gun leveled at his head. The other
two men move swiftly into the room - Neilson has his gun on
Sherlock.
Neilson has his gun on Sherlock.
On Sherlock, staring down the barrel, cool as ever.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
43.
SHERLOCK
... don’t you want me on the floor
too?
NEILSON
No, sir - I want you to open the
safe.
SHERLOCK
American. Interesting. Why would
you care -
NEILSON
Sir, the safe, now please.
SHERLOCK
I don’t know the code.
NEILSON
(Touches his ear)
We’ve been listening. She said she
told you.
SHERLOCK
If you’ve been listening, you know
she didn’t.
He raises his gun slightly, so it’s pointing directly at
Sherlock’s forehead.
NEILSON
I’m assuming I missed something -
from your reputation, I’m assuming
you didn’t - Mr. Holmes.
JOHN
For God’s sake, she’s the one who
knows - ask her!!
NEILSON
Yes, sir. She also knows the code
that automatically calls the
police, or sets off the burglar
alarm - I’ve learned not to trust
this woman.
IRENE ADLER
Mr. Holmes -
NEILSON
Shut up! One word out of you, just
one, I will decorate that wall with
the insides of your head. This, for
me, will not be hardship.
Irene falls silent - looks to Sherlock. Something intense in
her gaze, like she’s trying to communicate something.
NEILSON
Mr. Archer, at the count of three,
shoot Dr. Watson.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
44.
JOHN
Oh, for God’s sake, what??
SHERLOCK
I don’t know the code.
NEILSON
One.
SHERLOCK
I don’t know the code!
NEILSON
Two.
SHERLOCK
She didn’t tell me, I don’t know
it!!
NEILSON
I’m prepared to believe you - any
second now. Three!
SHERLOCK
No, stop!!
And he’s got it! The lights go on in his head.
He spins to the keypad. His hand over it now. Cutting fast
round -
Sherlock’s face: is he right?
Irene’s face: fascinated!
John’s face: oh shit!
And now Sherlock is punching in a code - six rapid beeps. And
the safe chimes. And the LED display reads OPEN.
On Sherlock sags. So close.
On John: oh dear God! But keeping it together.
NEILSON
Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Open it,
please.
Now, very fast - Sherlock glances to Irene -
- Irene, stricken-faced - tiniest shake of her head -
- Sherlock, a frown, a flicker of thought, gets it - now
reaching for safe door -
SHERLOCK
Vatican cameos!
On John, hearing that, recognising the words - what?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
45.
Now, stylised show motion -
- Sherlock slams open the safe door -
- in the same moment, he starts to duck -
- close on the interior of the safe, as the door opens -
- a handgun (also with silencer) mounted on a little tripod,
pointing out. A cable runs from the door, through hooks or
hoops, arranged so that the cable runs right over the trigger
-
- the action of the opening door, now tightening the cable
over the trigger -
- closer on the silenced muzzle as the bullet explodes from
the end -
- Archer, standing behind the still kneeling John, is the
direct line of fire -
- he starts to crumple -
- on Neilson, turning in shock - and Sherlock is already
cannoning into him -
- on Irene. She’s still kneeling in front of Tranter, who
stands behind her, gun at her head -
- and now she’s throwing punch backwards over her shoulder,
right into the man’s groin
- he starts to crumple -
- on John, leaping to retrieve the gun from Archer as he
falls -
Normal speed.
Sherlock has grabbed Neilson’s gun, now has it trained on
Neilson who is sprawled on the floor in front of him.
Similarly, Irene has Tranter’s gun aimed at him, as he’s
doubled up, retching on the floor.
John is checking Archer.
JOHN
... okay. He’s dead.
They all look at each other. What do they do now?
Sherlock steps smartly over Neilson, clubs him from behind
with the gun butt. He falls limps.
SHERLOCK
(To IRENE)
Would you mind?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
46.
IRENE ADLER
Not at all.
She moves to do the same to Archer. As she does so, Sherlock
glances towards the safe - there’s a little leopard skin
object in there.
Thump! Archer hits the floor.
SHERLOCK
Thank you.
IRENE ADLER
Thank you - you’re very ...
observant.
JOHN
Observant?
IRENE ADLER
I’m flattered.
SHERLOCK
(Striding from the room)
Don’t be.
JOHN
Flattered? Sorry, what?
He’s following Sherlock from the room.
74 INT. HALLWAY OF IRENE’S HOUSE - DAY 74
Sherlock is striding for the front door.
SHERLOCK
There must be more of them -
they’ll have back-up watching the
house.
JOHN
We should call the police.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
Sherlock has opened the door. In one motion he yanks the
silencer off the gun, and fires up into the sky. Blam! Blam!
Blam! Blam! Blam!
SHERLOCK
On their way.
JOHN
Oh, for God’s sake.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
47.
SHERLOCK
Shut up, it’s quick. Check the rest
of the house, see how they got in.
75 INT. IRENE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 75
IRENE is at the safe, looking inside for something.
SHERLOCK
(From off)
Well that’s the Knighthood in the
bag.
She spins. SHERLOCK, leaning in the doorway. He tosses
something in his hand.
Closer on it. A phone with a built in camera, blackberrystyle, but funkier. A leopard skin cover, a fetishists phone,
something we’d instantly recognise.
IRENE ADLER
That’s mine.
SHERLOCK
I take it they’re all on here? The
photographs.
He presses a button.
Close on the screen -
I AM
LOCKED
Four boxes appear in the centre of the screen, for the number
to be typed, so that it now appears
I AM
[] [] [] []
LOCKED
IRENE ADLER
I have other copies, of course.
SHERLOCK
No, you don’t. You’ll have
permanently disabled any kind of
connection or uplink - unless the
contents of this phone are provably
unique, you wouldn’t be able to
sell them.
IRENE ADLER
Who says I’m selling?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
48.
SHERLOCK
(Looking at the three
prone men)
But why are they interested?
Whatever’s on here, it’s more than
just photographs...
A cold stare from Irene. No flirtatiousness now, deadly
serious.
IRENE ADLER
It’s my life, Mr. Holmes. My
protection.
SHERLOCK
It was.
He tosses the phone in his hand again.
JOHN
(Calling from)
Sherlock!
Sherlock heads away.
Irene: that cold stare for a moment - then starts to follow.
76 INT. IRENE’S BEDROOM - DAY 76
Irene’s spectacular bedroom. The TALL WINDOWS stand open -
JOHN is kneeling by Kate who’s sprawled on the floor,
unconscious.
JOHN
Must have come in this way.
SHERLOCK
Clearly.
IRENE is coming into the room now.
JOHN
She’s okay, just out cold.
IRENE ADLER
Well God knows, she’s used to that.
There’s a back door - better check
it, Dr. Watson.
And she goes straight to her bedside table, rooting about in
it for something.
Sherlock and John - exhange a glance. Blimey, she’s cold.
Sherlock gives John a nod.
JOHN
Sure.
John heads out.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
49.
SHERLOCK
You’re very calm - your booby trap
just killed a man.
IRENE ADLER
Well he’d have killed me - it was
self-defence in advance.
And she turns with what’s she taken from bedside cabinet -
- and slams a hypodermic into his arm. Sherlock shoots to his
feet.
SHERLOCK
What?? What have you - ??
He’s reeling now, trying to grab the hypo from his arm. Irene
slaps him hard across the face.
IRENE ADLER
Give it to me.
He staggers against the wall - tries to get away from her.
She steps calmly forward, slaps him hard again.
IRENE ADLER
Now! Give it to me!
He reels away from her, but clinging to consciousness,
gripping on to that damn camera-phone.
SHERLOCK
No!
IRENE ADLER
Oh, for goodness sake!
She snatches up her riding crop from the bedside table - now
slashes at him, calm and expert. More lion-tamer, than
sadist.
IRENE ADLER
Drop it.
(Slashes )
I said, drop it!
She cracks him across the back of the hand. He drops the
camera-phone, with a cry.
She kneels by him, picks up the camera phone, smiles.
IRENE ADLER
Thankyou, dear. Now tell that sweet
little posh thing, the pictures are
safe with me. They’re not for
blackmail, just insurance. Besides -
I might want to see her again.
He makes a flailing grab for the camera-phone - she easily
avoids.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
50.
IRENE ADLER
No, no - it’s been a pleasure,
don’t spoil it.
(Tickle him under the chin
with her crop)
This is how I want you to remember
me - the woman who beat you. Good
night, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
JOHN
Jesus!
John has just come back through the door, staring now.
JOHN
What are you doing?
Irene is already stepping to the window, starting to climb
out.
IRENE ADLER
He’ll sleep for a few hours. Make
sure he doesn’t choke on his own
vomit, it makes for a very
unattractive corpse.
John, now finding the hypodermic -
JOHN
What is this, what did you give
him. Sherlock??
IRENE ADLER
He’ll be fine, I’ve used it on
loads of my friends.
JOHN
Sherlock, can you hear me??
Irene, about to climb out the window, turns back for a
moment, contemplating Sherlock. He’s still grimly clinging to
consciously, trying to sit up, fighting for breath.
IRENE ADLER
You know, I was wrong about him. He
did know where to look.
JOHN
For what? What are you talking
about?
IRENE ADLER
The keycode to my safe.
JOHN
What was it?
IRENE ADLER
(To Sherlock)
Shall I tell him?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
51.
(MORE)
(A best - smiles at John)
My measurements.
On John - oh!
On Sherlock, losing the fight - he flops back on the floor.
- we hold on him a moment, and then:
And then (a bit like with Phil the driver earlier) the camera
spins on its axis, as if turning Sherlock upright again and
we:
77 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 77
- this time it’s SHERLOCK, not Phil, sitting at the wheel. He
looks a little dazed, confused. The image is slightly,
twisted, distorted - dreamy.
And where Sherlock swanned past last time, this time it’s
IRENE.
IRENE ADLER
Got it!
Sherlock blinks confusedly at her.
IRENE ADLER
Shh, now, don’t get up. I’ll do the
talking. So the car’s about to backfire ... and the hiker ...
She looks to the HIKER. We whip pan to:
The frozen HIKER, staring at the sky. We widen the shot to
include -
SHERLOCK and IRENE, standing a few feet from him, observers
only. (Sherlock in his normal suit, Irene now in Sherlock’s
coat.)
IRENE ADLER
... is staring at the sky. You said
he could be watching the birds -
but he wasn’t, was he? He was
watching another kind of flying
thing.
Bang!
IRENE ADLER
The car back-fires, the hiker turns
to look.
The Hiker turn to look behind him ...
Now from the POV of something flying through the air, superfast, towards the Hiker. We go slamming right into the back
of the Hiker’s head, and the screen goes black.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
52.
IRENE ADLER (cont'd)
IRENE ADLER
Which was his big mistake ...
On Phil looking out his car, to see:
Phil’s POV. The Hiker now lying dead.
IRENE ADLER
By the time the driver looks up,
the hiker is already dead. What he
doesn’t see is what killed him -
because it’s fallen in the stream.
Shot from above the stream, bubbling along.
IRENE ADLER
(From off)
An accomplished sportsman recently
returned from foreign travel - with
a boomerang.
And there, floating downstream, is a blood-stained boomerang.
We pan up to see Sherlock and Irene watching it float away.
IRENE ADLER
You got all that from one look.
Definitely the new sexy.
SHERLOCK
I ... I don’t ...
Closer on Irene - now more stylised, she’s surrounded by
darkness.
IRENE ADLER
Hush now, it’s okay.
(Kissing his cheek)
I’m only returning your coat.
88 INT. SHERLOCK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 88
On Sherlock startling awake!
Where is he?? In his bed! How the hell did he get here??
SHERLOCK
John! John!
He’s trying to climb out of bed now, so unsteady on his feet,
drunken.
The door is opening, John is there.
JOHN
You okay?
SHERLOCK
How did I get here?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
53.
JOHN
I don’t suppose you remember much,
you weren’t making a lot of sense.
Should warn you, I think Lestrade
filmed you on his phone.
SHERLOCK
Where is she?
JOHN
Where’s who?
SHERLOCK
She was here, the woman, that
woman.
Sherlock is looking around wildly - clearly no one else is
here. But the window - just a little open, curtain blowing in
the breeze.
JOHN
What woman?
SHERLOCK
The woman - the woman woman.
JOHN
Irene Adler? She got away, no one
saw her - she wasn’t here,
Sherlock.
Sherlock is checking under his bed now. John is hauling him
back to his feet.
JOHN
Back in bed, you’ll be fine in the
morning. Just sleep!
SHERLOCK
Yes, of course I’ll be fine. I am
fine, I’m absolutely fine!
He’s climbing unsteadily back into bed.
JOHN
Yep, you are, you’re just great.
I’ll be right next door if you need
me.
SHERLOCK
Why would I need you?
JOHN
No reason at all
And John goes, closing the door.
- revealing something hanging on the hook on the back.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
54.
Sherlock doesn’t see it for a moment - then does. His coat -
returned.
He stares at it for a moment. How did that happen?
And then - a little orgasmic gasp. Definitely female. Where
did that come from?
On his coat - something is glowing. He steps groggily, and
retrieves his own phone from the own pocket. He’s received a
text (the gasp was the text arriving.) He reads it.
TEXT ON SCREEN: Good night, Mr. Holmes.
On Sherlock’s face, frowning at the text. In the faint light
of the phone, we see a kiss of lipstick on his cheek.
89 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - MORNING 89
On MYCROFT, irate.
MYCROFT
How about the foreign legion?
Mycroft is pacing the floor, furious. SHERLOCK and JOHN are
having their breakfast, doing their best to ignore him. MRS
HUDSON is cleaning up in the kitchen, and generally not being
a housekeeper.
MYCROFT
Does one still join the foreign
legion, when in disgrace - what is
the modern form? Do you retire to
the study with a loaded revolver,
or take a job in Manchester?
SHERLOCK
The photographs are perfectly safe.
MYCROFT
In the hands of a fugitive sex
worker?
SHERLOCK
She’s not interested in blackmail -
I think she just wants ...
protection, for some reason. I take
it you’ve stood down the police
investigation into the shooting at
her house?
MYCROFT
How we can do anything, while she
has those photographs? Our hands
are tied.
SHERLOCK
She would applaud your choice of
words. You see how it works?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
55.
(MORE)
That camera is her get-out-of-jail
free card. You have to leave her
alone. Treat her like royalty,
Mycroft.
JOHN
Though not the way she treats
royalty.
Sherlock laughs -
- and as he does there’s a little orgasmic gasp. Everyone
startles a little. Sherlock just picks up his phone, glances
at it.
ON SCREEN TEXT: Good morning, Mr. Holmes.
JOHN
What was that?
SHERLOCK
Just a text.
JOHN
But what was the noise?
SHERLOCK
Did you know there were other
people after her too. Before you
sent John and me in there? CIA
trained killers, at an excellent
guess.
JOHN
Yeah, cheers for that, Mycroft.
Mrs Hudson pipes up from the kitchen.
MRS HUDSON
It’s disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.
Family’s all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!
MYCROFT
Oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson!
SHERLOCK
(Outraged)
Mycroft!
JOHN
(Outraged)
Oi!
Two indignant stares, and Mycroft realises he’s crossed a
line.
MYCROFT
(To Mrs Hudson)
Apologies.
MRS HUDSON
Thankyou!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
56.
SHERLOCK (cont'd)
SHERLOCK
Though do, in fact, shut up.
Another little orgasmic gasp.
MRS HUDSON
Oh, it’s a bit rude, that noise,
isn’t it?
Sherlock absently checks his phone as he continues talking -
John watching him, curiously.
SHERLOCK
There’s nothing you can do for now -
and nothing she will do, as far I
understand.
During above:
ON SCREEN TEXT: Feeling better?
Sherlock puts the phone down again.
MYCROFT
I can put maximum surveillance on
her.
SHERLOCK
Why bother - you can follow her on
twitter. I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.
MYCROFT
Yes, most amusing - excuse me.
He’s now answering his phone, which has been buzzing. He
steps away for a whispered conversation.
John has been dying to know:
JOHN
Why does your phone make that
noise?
SHERLOCK
What noise?
JOHN
That noise - the one it just made.
SHERLOCK
It’s a text alert. It means I’ve
got a text.
JOHN
Your texts don’t usually make that
noise.
Sherlock now studying the paper, really not wanting to get
into this.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
57.
SHERLOCK
Well. Someone got hold of my phone,
and for a joke, apparently,
personalised their text alert
noise.
JOHN
So every time they text you ...
Another orgasmic gasp.
SHERLOCK
It would seem so.
MRS HUDSON
(From the kitchen, a
little flustered)
Could you turn that phone down a
bit, at my time of life.
He glances at the phone:
ON-SCREEN TEXT: I’m fine, since you didn’t ask.
He lays aside the phone again - pointedly, face down. John,
looking at him, pondering. Maybe even smiling a bit.
JOHN
I’m just wondering who could have
got hold of your phone recently.
Cos it would’ve been in your coat,
wouldn’t it?
SHERLOCK
I leave you to your deductions.
JOHN
I’m not stupid, you know.
SHERLOCK
Where do you get that idea?
He glances over at Mycroft, just concluding his call.
MYCROFT
Bond Air is go, that’s decided -
check with the Coventry lot. Talk
later.
Mycroft clicking stepping over, phone call done. The moment
he clicks.
SHERLOCK
What else does she have?
(Off Mycroft’s frown)
Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn’t
be interested in a few compromising
photographs, there’s more. A lot
more. There’s something big coming -
isn’t there?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
58.
MYCROFT
Irene Adler is no longer any
concern of yours. From now, you
will stay out of this.
SHERLOCK
Oh, will I?
MYCROFT
Yes, Sherlock, you will. Now if
you’ll excuse me, I have a long and
arduous apology to make to a very
old friend.
SHERLOCK
Give her my love.
He’s snatched up his violin and plays Mycroft out the door -
God Save The Queen.
Mycroft just rolls his eyes - when will he grow up.
We cut to just outside the window, pulling back from the
little domestic scene inside. We can still see Sherlock
playing, still hear the music, as we dissolve to:
90 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 90
... the same window, but now there are CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
around it, and maybe even a little snow drifting past. And
the violin is still playing, but it’s “We Wish You A Merry
Christmas.”
Inside. Christmas Eve in Baker Street. MRS HUDSON is sitting
in the chair by the fire, looking happier than we have ever
seen her. JOHN, wearing a SANTA HAT, is pouring her a cup of
tea and JEANETTE (a pretty woman we haven’t seen before) is
serving her a TRAY OF MINCE PIES. SHERLOCK stands on the run,
serenading her with his VIOLIN.
He comes to the end with an elaborate flourish and a deep
bow.
MRS HUDSON
Oh, that was lovely, Sherlock, just
lovely. But I wish you’d worn the
antlers.
SHERLOCK
Some things, Mrs. Hudson, are best
left to the imagination.
Lestrade pipes up from the kitchen - he’s sitting there with
a drink, and he’s probably had a few.
LESTRADE
Nah, I’ve got photoshop on my
computer - hours of fun after a day
of Sherlock.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
59.
JOHN
Yeah.
(Off Sherlock’s look)
Sorry.
SHERLOCK
Still here, are you? I had no idea
we had so much gin. No thank you,
Sarah.
He’s speaking Jeanette who’s offering him the tray of mince
pies. The room drops a degree.
John, appears next to Jeanette, arm round her.
JOHN
He’s not good at names.
SHERLOCK
No, hang on, I know this. Sarah was
the doctor one, then there was the
spotty one, the nose one, and who
came after the boring teacher?
JEANETTE
Nobody.
SHERLOCK
Jeanette! Process of elimination.
Now bustling through the doors, Molly Hooper, with big
shopping bags full of presents.
MOLLY
Hello everyone, sorry, hello. It
said on the door, just to come up.
SHERLOCK
(Under his breath)
Oh dear Lord.
MRS HUDSON
Molly, dear, in you come.
JOHN
Hello, Molly!
JEANETTE
Hello, Molly.
LESTRADE
Hello, Moll -
SHERLOCK
Is everyone going to say hello to
everyone??
MOLLY
Are we having a Christmas drinkies
then?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
60.
SHERLOCK
There’s no stopping them.
Apparently.
Sherlock is now at this desk, busying himself.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
60A.
MRS HUDSON
It’s the one day a year the boys
have to be nice to me. It’s almost
worth it.
SHERLOCK
John, this counter’s stuck.
(He’s pointing to John’s
laptop)
On your blog, it’s still 1895.
JOHN
Oh no - Christmas is cancelled.
SHERLOCK
And you’ve got a photograph of me
in that hat!
On John’s laptop screen, a photo of Sherlock in the
deerstalker - illustrating a story called “The Six
Thatchers.”
JOHN
People like the hat.
SHERLOCK
No they don’t. What people??
MOLLY
How’s the hip?
MRS HUDSON
Atrocious, thanks for asking.
MOLLY
Oh, I’ve seen worse. But then, I do
post-mortems.
(Colours)
Oh God, sorry, I just - oh!
SHERLOCK
Don’t make jokes, Molly.
MOLLY
No. sorry.
(To Lestrade)
Didn’t expect to see you - I
thought you were going to Dorset
for Christmas.
LESTRADE
First thing tomorrow, me and the
wife. Back together, all sorted.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
61.
SHERLOCK
No. She’s sleeping with a PE
teacher.
MOLLY
... and John, I hear you’re off to
your sister’s, is that right?
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.
JOHN
First time ever. She’s cleaned up
her act, she’s off the booze.
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
... shut up, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
I see you’ve got a new boyfriend,
Molly, and you’re serious about
him.
Molly: instantly blushing.
MOLLY
... What? Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
And in fact, you’re going to see
him this very night and deliver him
a present.
JOHN
Oh, take a day off!
LESTRADE
Shut up and have a drink.
SHERLOCK
But surely you’ve noticed the top
present in the bag.
He’s pointing to a splendidly wrapped present, in red
wrapping paper.
SHERLOCK
Perfectly wrapped, with a bow,
whereas the others are all slapdash
at best. It’s for someone special
then. The shade of red echoes her
lipstick - either an unconscious
association, or one she’s
deliberately trying to encourage.
Either way, Miss Hooper has love on
her mind.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
62.
(MORE)
That she’s serious about him, is
clear from the fact she’s giving
him a Christmas gift at all - that
always suggests long term hopes,
however forlorn - and the fact that
she’s seeing him tonight is evident
from her make up and clothing.
She’s obviously trying to
compensate for the size of her
mouth and breasts -
As he speaks he’s picked up the parcel, taken a look -
- and now freeze in the closest he gets to embarrassment. The
label says Sherlock. An aching silence.
Everyone avoiding looking at anyone - cos everyone saw this
train crash coming.
Finally:
On Molly - so discomforted, almost tearful.
MOLLY
You always say such horrible
things. Every time, you’re just so
mean, always, always...
Train crash now getting worse. No one can even look at
Sherlock now.
On Sherlock: and even he - perhaps for the first time ever -
is getting it. He glances round to the others - no help there
- and is about to step away...but no. He can do better! He
almost has to brace himself, but ...
SHERLOCK
I’m sorry. Forgive me.
John, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade - just staring. What? That’s new,
what??
Sherlock touches Molly’s arm.
SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.
And he leans in and - a little stiff, a little formal, but
meaning it - kisses her on the cheek.
On John watching - almost smiling, almost proud. Sherlock
Holmes, being human.
Sherlock straightens up from Molly, and she’s just staring at
him. A moment of kindness - the first one ever. She opens
hermouth to speak, but before she can -
- an orgasmic gasp (Sherlock’s phone.)
Molly’s hand flies to her mouth.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
63.
SHERLOCK (cont'd)
MOLLY
No, that wasn’t - I didn’t -
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
63A.
SHERLOCK
No, it’s fine, it was me.
LESTRADE
My God, really?
SHERLOCK
My phone.
He’s pulled his phone from his jacket, now looks at the text.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Mantelpiece.
JOHN
Fifty-seven.
SHERLOCK
Sorry, what?
Sherlock is looking over at the Mantelpiece. There’s a tiny
little red parcel there, with a bow on it.
JOHN
Fifty-seven of those texts - just
the ones I’ve heard.
SHERLOCK
How thrilling that you’ve counted.
Sherlock is now examining the little parcel. A bow on it.
Red. (NB. It’s not identical to Molly’s parcel, but clearly
the same set of impulses went into it.)
Quick flash: Irene’s lipsticked mouth - the same shade as the
paper.
SHERLOCK
Excuse me!
Now he’s striding through the kitchen, heading for his room.
JOHN
What’s wrong? Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
I said, excuse me!
JOHN
Do you ever reply?
But he’s gone.
91 INT. SHERLOCK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 91
Sherlock now ripping the wrapping paper off to reveal -
- Irene’s leopard skin camera-phone.
He stares at it! No! Why?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
64.
An orgasmic gasp. He checks his phone.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Merry Christmas, Mr. Holmes.
92 INT. MYCROFT’S STUDY - NIGHT 92
Mycroft, in a leather armchair, in a cold and lofty study, in
his cold and lofty home.
MYCROFT
Oh dear Lord, we’re not going to
have Christmas phone calls now, are
we? Have they passed a new law?
93 INT. SHERLOCK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 93
On SHERLOCK, sitting on his bed, on the phone. We intercut.
SHERLOCK
I think you’re going to find Irene
Adler tonight.
MYCROFT
We already know where she is. As
you were kind enough to point out,
it hardly matters.
SHERLOCK
No. I think you’re going to find
her dead.
As he says this he turns to see -
- JOHN, leaning in the doorway. Clearly been listening.
Sherlock instantly snaps the phone off, stands, looks coldly
at John. Doesn’t like being interrupted.
JOHN
You okay?
SHERLOCK
Yes.
And Sherlock steps forward and closes the door in John’s
face.
94 EXT. BARTS - NIGHT 94
Establisher of BARTS by night. Still a little snow drifting
through frame.
CAPTION:
CHRISTMAS DAY 2 AM.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
65.
95 INT. BARTS/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 95
A long, bleak, cold corridor. Marching along it, towards us,
MYCROFT and SHERLOCK.
96 INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 96
A BODY on the the slab, covered, ready to be identified.
MOLLY waiting there. Now SHERLOCK and MYCROFT coming into the
room.
MYCROFT
The only one who fitted the
description. Had her taken here,
your home from home.
SHERLOCK
You didn’t need to come in, Molly.
MOLLY
It’s okay, everybody else was busy
with ... Christmas.
She winces, again giving away too much of her lonely life.
She’s pulling back the sheet now.
MOLLY
I’m afraid her face is a bit sort
of bashed, it might be a little bit
difficult.
Sherlock and Mycroft look coldly down. (We don’t see.)
MYCROFT
It’s her, isn’t it?
SHERLOCK
Show me the rest of her.
Molly hesitates, then pulls back the rest of the sheet.
SHERLOCK
(Looking at her)
It’s her.
He turns, walks out.
MYCROFT
Thank you, Miss Hooper.
MOLLY
Who is she? How did Sherlock
recognise her from ... not her
face.
On Mycroft - he’s been pondering the same thing. Doesn’t
answer, just turns on his heel.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
66.
97 INT. BARTS/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 97
SHERLOCK, standing staring out of the window at the end of
the corridor, watching the snow fall. He doesn’t look sad -
just faintly preoccupied.
MYCROFT appears next to him, holds up a cigarette, offering
it to him.
MYCROFT
Just the one.
SHERLOCK
Why?
MYCROFT
Merry Christmas.
Sherlock smiles, takes it. Mycroft starts lighting it for
him.
SHERLOCK
Smoking indoors. Isn’t there one of
those law things?
MYCROFT
We’re in a morgue - there’s only so
much damage you can do. How did you
know she was dead?
SHERLOCK
She had an item in her possession -
one she told me her life depended
on. She chose to give it up.
MYCROFT
Where is this item now?
Sherlock doesn’t answer. He’s looking down the corridor - at
the far, three people have emerged from the mortuary. A
MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, and an OLDER WOMAN. They’re all clutching
each other, sobbing. Clearly they have also had some bad
news. A mortuary attendant stands at a respectful distance.
Sherlock regards them, clinically.
SHERLOCK
Look at them. They all care so
much. Do you ever wonder if there’s
something wrong with us?
MYCROFT
All lives end, all hearts are
broken. Caring is not an advantage,
Sherlock.
That last word, just a little pointed. Like a gentle,
brotherly warning.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
67.
Sherlock just sucks at his cigarette. Then frowns at it.
SHERLOCK
This is low tar.
MYCROFT
Well you barely knew her.
Sherlock gives an abrupt little laugh. Then starts heading
away down the corridor. As he goes -
SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.
We hold on Mycroft, framed against the window, the snow, and
the dark. Such a cold figure.
MYCROFT
And a happy new year.
As Sherlock’s footsteps echo away, Mycroft already has his
phone out, dialling. Now the phone is being answered.
MYCROFT
He’s on his way. Have you found
anything?
98 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 98
Turning into close-up, phone at his ear, JOHN. We now
intercut.
JOHN
No. Did he take the cigarette?
MYCROFT
Yes.
JOHN
Shit.
(Turns, calls)
He’s coming. Ten minutes.
MRS HUDSON now emerging from Sherlock’s bedroom. We also see
Jeanette sitting on the sofa, watching all this, a bit
crossly.
MRS HUDSON
Nothing in the bedroom.
JOHN
Looks like he’s clean anyway, we’ve
checked all the usual places. Are
you sure tonight’s a danger night?
MYCROFT
No, but I never am. You have to
stay with him.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
68.
JOHN
(Glancing at Jeanette)
I’ve got plans.
MYCROFT
No.
Mycroft hangs up. John’s face - damn it. Turns to Jeanette.
JOHN
Look, I’m really sorry -
JEANETTE
You know, my friends are wrong
about you - you’re a great
boyfriend.
JOHN
Well, that’s good, I always thought
I was great, but -
JEANETTE
Sherlock Holmes is a lucky man.
She’s already getting up, pulling on a coat, so cross -
JOHN
Jeanette - please -
JEANETTE
No, I mean it. It’s heartwarming,
you’ll do anything for him.
And he can’t even tell your
girlfriends apart!
JOHN
I do things for you. What is it I’m
not doing - just tell me, what?
JEANETTE
Don’t make me compete with Sherlock
Holmes.
JOHN
I’ll walk your dog. There you go, I
give in - I’ll even walk your
stupid dog for you!
JEANETTE
... I don’t have a dog.
JOHN
Oh, no, that was ... that was the
last ... okay.
John’s face: no good way out of this one.
JEANETTE
Jesus!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
69.
And she storms away down the stairs.
JOHN
(Calling after her)
I’ll phone you.
JEANETTE
No.
JOHN
Okay.
MRS HUDSON
That really wasn’t very good, was
it, dear?
99 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 99
JOHN sitting by the fire. Glass of brandy in hand, trying to
concentrate on a book. But really, he’s waiting.
Outside some drunken revellers are singing “God Rest Ye Merry
Gentlemen.” Distant, lonely, eerie.
We hear the door. John looks round.
SHERLOCK, standing in the doorway, sombre.
John, relieved to see him, hiding it.
JOHN
Hi. You okay?
Sherlock reflects for a moment. He scans around the room - a
forensic sweep of a look.
SHERLOCK
Hope you haven’t messed up my sock
index this time!
And we hear his bedroom door bang!
Oh JOHN: damn! And over this we hear a soaring sad melody,
being played on a violin...
100 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 100
SHERLOCK, in his DRESSING GOWN, is playing this sweetest
saddest tune on his VIOLIN. He stands at the window, focussed
on the music. JOHN is pottering about the flat - putting on
his coat, clearly about to go out. MRS HUDSON is clearing
away plates from where John and Sherlock have been eating.
John’s plate is cleared, Sherlock’s is untouched.
Mrs Hudson pointedly shows the plate to John as she heads to
the kitchen. He hasn’t eaten again.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
70.
MRS HUDSON
Lovely tune. Haven’t heard that one
before, Sherlock.
Sherlock stops for a moment, makes a mark on sheet of
manuscript.
JOHN
Are you composing?
SHERLOCK
Helps me think.
The sad, haunting tune continues.
JOHN
What are you thinking about?
And a discordant note from Sherlock - he throws down the
violin, strides over to where John’s laptop stands open at
his desk. He’s pulled from his dressing gown pocket, Irene’s
leopard skin phone.
Sherlock has pulled up John’s blog page. The counter still
stands at 1895.
SHERLOCK
Your blog counter - it’s still
stuck at 1895.
JOHN
Yeah - it’s faulty, I can’t seem to
fix it.
SHERLOCK
Faulty, or you’ve been hacked, and
it’s a message.
On the leopard skin phone, the screen:
I AM
[] [] [] []
LOCKED
In the four empty boxes, he enters 1895.
She screen flashes red, and
WRONG PASSCODE.
TWO ATTEMPTS REMAINING.
SHERLOCK
No, it’s just faulty.
Sherlock’s face - damn it!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
71.
He heads back to his violin, picks it starts playing again.
That same haunting tune.
JOHN
Okay. Going out for a bit.
Sherlock ignores him, carries on that sad, sad tune. But his
face: unreadable.
John, watching him a moment. What’s he thinking, what’s he
feeling. No clue. He starts towards the stairs, passes Mrs
Hudson. On impulse, he pulls her aside.
JOHN
Has he ever had ... anyone.
Girlfriend, boyfriend, any kind of
relationship?
MRS HUDSON
I don’t know.
JOHN
How can we not know?
MRS HUDSON
He’s Sherlock. We’ll never know
what’s going on in that funny old
head.
101 EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY 101
John, coming out the door of 221B. A beautiful woman, turns
as he passes.
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
(From off)
John?
JOHN
(Turning)
Hello.
(Registers that he doesn’t
know her)
Hello?
(Registers that she’s
beautiful and he’d better
start making an effort)
Hello!
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
So any plans for New Year tonight?
JOHN
Well. Nothing fixed. Nothing I
couldn’t heartlessly abandon. Any
ideas?
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
One.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
72.
A BIG BLACK CAR is sliding up the kerb between them. She
steps over, goes to one of rear doors, and holds it open for
him.
John sags. Oh!
We cut to a higher shot of John now climbing into the car.
The POV of:
SHERLOCK, watching from the window.
On John, now climbing into the car.
JOHN
You know, Mycroft could just phone
me! If he didn’t have some bloody
stupid power complex!
102 EXT. BATTERSEA POWER STATION - DAY 102
The big black car now rolls to halt outside the ruined old
building.
On JOHN, staring through the window at his destination.
JOHN
Seriously?
INT. BATTERSEA POWER STATION/WALKWAY - DAY
JOHN and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN now heading along a suspended
walkway together, John looking around the huge, abandoned
building.
JOHN
Couldn’t we just go to a cafe?
Sherlock doesn’t follow me
everywhere!
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Through here.
She’s now gesturing towards a door. John duck through it.
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
(Into phone)
He’s on his way. You were right -
he thinks it’s Mycroft.
103 INT. ABANDONED CONTROL ROOM - DAY 103
John, waiting. Face sombre, distracted. A movement from off -
steps approaching in the gloom.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
73.
JOHN
He’s writing sad music. Doesn’t
eat, barely talks, except to
correct the television. I’d say he
was heartbroken, but he’s Sherlock,
he does all that anyway...
He’s turned to look at Mycroft -
- and just stares.
Because it isn’t Mycroft, it’s IRENE ADLER. (As dramatic and
mysterious as we can get away with - cape and hood?)
IRENE ADLER
Hello, Dr. Watson.
A silence. John, just appalled, just for a moment, wordless.
Then:
JOHN
Tell him you’re alive.
IRENE ADLER
He’d come after me.
JOHN
I’ll come after you if you don’t.
IRENE ADLER
I believe you.
JOHN
You were dead on a slab. It was
definitely you!
IRENE ADLER
DNA tests are only as good as the
records you keep.
JOHN
Oh, and I bet you know the recordkeeper.
IRENE ADLER
I know what he likes. And I needed
to disappear...
JOHN
Then how come I can see you - and I
don’t even want to!
IRENE ADLER
I made a mistake. I sent Sherlock
something for safe-keeping, now I
need it back. So I need your help.
JOHN
No.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
74.
IRENE ADLER
It’s for his own safety.
JOHN
So’s this - tell him you’re alive.
IRENE ADLER
I can’t.
JOHN
Fine, I’ll tell him. And I still
won’t help you.
A silence. Then she pulls out her phone (NOT the leopard skin
camera phone, just her regular mobile.)
IRENE ADLER
What do I say?
JOHN
What do you normally say? You
texted him a lot.
IRENE ADLER
Just the usual stuff.
JOHN
There is no “usual” in this case.
IRENE ADLER
“Good morning”. “I like your funny
hat”. “I’m sad tonight, let’s have
dinner.” “You looked sexy on
Crimewatch, let’s have dinner.”
“I’m not hungry - let’s have
dinner.”
JOHN
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes?
IRENE ADLER
At him. He never replies.
JOHN
Sherlock always replies, to
everything. He can’t help himself -
he’s Mr. Punchline. He’ll outlive
God, trying to have the last word.
IRENE ADLER
Does that make me special?
JOHN
I don’t know. Maybe.
IRENE ADLER
Are you jealous?
JOHN
For God’s sake. We’re not a couple.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
75.
IRENE ADLER
Yes, you are.
(Sends text - shows John
that it’s sent)
“I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.”
JOHN
... Who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes, but for the
record, if anyone out there still
cares, I’m not actually gay.
IRENE ADLER
I am. And look at us both.
A moment. And they both smile. Now laughing - a shared moment
of warmth at the absurdity of their conversation. Cut short
by:
From the shadows, a familiar ORGASMIC GASP. The text has
arrived.
Irene and John startle, turn, look into the shadows of the
ancient room -
- is there just an outline standing there, black against
black.
And before they can be sure, the scrape of a foot, and
footsteps heading rapidly away into the dark.
John, stricken now, makes to follow. Irene stops him.
IRENE ADLER
I don’t think so - do you?
104 EXT. BAKER STREET - EVENING 104
Sherlock heading along the street.
Tight on his face now - again, just blank, unreadable. What’s
going on in that head?
Now at the door to 221B. Stops. Stares. Oh!
SHERLOCK VISION: the door is standing minutely open. Zooming
in super close: tiny SPLINTERS and GASHES in the paintwork of
the door, freshly made. Has someone forced their way in?
Sherlock, cold as ice now, so alert. He steps through the
door.
105 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AT 221B - EVENING 105
Sherlock now coming carefully through the door, scanning.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
76.
SHERLOCK VISION: Mrs Hudson’s door, standing open. Zooming to
- Mrs Hudson’s bucket of cleaning things, standing abandoned
in the corner (an disinfectant spray bottle is prominent, but
not featured.) Zooming to the stairs now. Super close - new
black scuff mark on the skirting
VERY FAST FLASHBACK: Two pairs of black shoes climbing
stairs, Mrs Hudson’s feet between them - she’s clearly
struggling. One of the black shoes scuffs against the
paintwork.
SHERLOCK VISION: Now zooming fast on a tiny tear in the
wallpaper.
VERY FAST FLASHBACK: Mrs Hudson’s hand trying to cling to the
wall, her fingernail tears the paper...
Close on Sherlock’s face. Full alert now - bad news for
someone.
106 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - EVENING 106
MRS HUDSON sitting terrified on a chair. NEILSON (one of the
Americans) has a GUN leveled right at her head. He has two
black suited goons - TRANTER and a new one - standing by the
fireplace.
And now SHERLOCK comes strolling through the door, cool as
anything, hands clasped behind him, cool as anything - like
Prince Charles on an official visit.
Mrs Hudson gives a little whimper as she sees him.
SHERLOCK
Please don’t snivel, Mrs. Hudson -
it does nothing to impede the
flight of a bullet. What a tender
world that would be.
MRS HUDSON
Sorry, Sherlock.
On Sherlock, as his eyes flick to:
SHERLOCK VISION: we zoom in a red mark on Mrs Hudson’s face.
She’s been slapped, hard. Zooming in further - there is a
little trickle of blood in the centre of the bruise.
We pans super fast to Neilson’s hand holding the gun. Now
zooming in on the ring on his finger. There’s a tiny smear of
blood.
NEILSON
I believe you have something that
we want, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
Then you should ask for it.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011

Sherlock has stepped forward to Mrs Hudson. Gently he pushes
one of her sleeves up - blotches on her arm. Finger marks
where she’s been tightly gripped. Now his fingers go to where
there’s a rip in her blouse - he’s almost tender. She’s been
roughed up - and now she’s shaking like a leaf.
NEILSON
I’ve been asking this one - she
doesn’t seem to know anything. But
you know what I’m asking for, don’t
you, Mr. Holmes?
Sherlock’s gaze slams on to Neilson - a stare like cold blue
lasers.
SHERLOCK
I believe I do.
On Neilson - and now swirling round him, words start swirling
round him. CARTOID ARTERY. RIBS. SKULL. LUNGS. EYES. THROAT.
The word ARTERY appears over several areas on his body.
Sherlock Holmes, choosing a target.
Neilson levels his gun at Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
First, send your boys away.
NEILSON
Why?
SHERLOCK
I dislike being outnumbered. It
makes for too much stupid in the
room.
NEILSON
You two, go to the car.
They start moving.
SHERLOCK
Then get in the car and drive away.
Don’t try to trick me - you know
who I am, it doesn’t work.
The two men leave.
SHERLOCK
Next, stop pointing that gun at me.
NEILSON
So you can point a gun at me?
SHERLOCK
I’m unarmed.
NEILSON
You don’t mind if I check?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
78.
SHERLOCK
I insist.
Neilson steps forward, and with his gun still trained on him,
he starts briskly and efficiently frisking with his other
hand. As he bends to his task, Sherlock helpfully raises his
hands over his head -
- we pan up with them and now see what he’s been concealing
behind him. The SPRAY BOTTLE from Mrs Hudson’s cleaning
bucket, held in his hand.
He glances at Mrs Hudson over Neilson’s shoulder. She’s seen
the aerosol gives him an impish smile - he just rolls his
eyes at the stupidity of goons these day -
- and as Neilson straightens up, he blasts him right in the
face with the spray bottle. Neilson screams and -
SHERLOCK
Moron!
- Sherlock gives him a cracking headbutt!
107 EXT. BAKER STREET - EVENING 107
John is just climbing out of the big black car -
- to see a NOTE pinned to the door of 221b. In Sherlock’s
handwriting it says:
CRIME IN PROGRESS. PLEASE DISTURB.
- and John is already running.
108 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - EVENING 108
John comes bursting through the door of the flat to discover -
Neilson, now handcuffed to chair, with gaffer tape across his
* mouth.
Sherlock, pacing, with phone at his ear.
JOHN
What’s going on? What the hell is
happening??
SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson has been slapped by an
American - I’m restoring balance to
the universe.
Now sees Mrs Hudson, on the sofa, still recovering.
JOHN
Oh, my God, Mrs Hudson, are you all
right? Jesus, what did they do?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
79.
MRS HUDSON
Oh, I’m being so silly.
And she’s sobbing against him now.
SHERLOCK
Downstairs, take her downstairs,
look after her.
JOHN
(Helping her to the door)
Are you going to explain what’s
been going on here?
SHERLOCK
I expect so, now go!
(Into phone)
Lestrade! We’ve had a break-in at
Baker Street. Send your least
irritating officers, and an
ambulance.
(An ambulance?)
No, no, we’re fine. But the burglar
seems to have got himself badly
injured.
On Neilson’s eyes, widening. What. What?? (Lestrade is
asking, what do mean, badly injured?)
Sherlock is looking speculatively at his prisoner.
SHERLOCK
Oh, you know. Few broken ribs,
skull fracture, possibly a
punctured lung - he fell out the
window.
And he snaps his phone shut savagely shut -
- and looks down at Neilson like the wrath of God...
On Neilson’s face. Oh shit.
109 INT. MRS HUDSON’S KITCHEN - EVENING 109
John and Mrs Hudson, as John cleans her wound -
- and there is the sound of breaking glass, then a tremendous
crash from outside the window next to them. Something has
landed with a huge clamour, but through the net curtains, we
can’t quite see what’s happened.
MRS HUDSON
That was right on my bins!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
80.
110 EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT 110
An ambulance is pulling away from 221B. We pan with it,
taking as to a shot of LESTRADE and SHERLOCK, face to face.
LESTRADE
And exactly how many times did he
fall out of that window?
SHERLOCK
It was all a bit of a blur,
Detective Inspector. I lost count.
111 INT. MRS HUDSON’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 111
JOHN sitting with a still shaky Mrs Hudson as Sherlock
enters.
JOHN
She’ll have to sleep upstairs in
our flat tonight - we need to look
after her.
SHERLOCK
Of course, but she’s fine.
JOHN
No, she’s not, look at her. She’s
got to take some time away from
Baker Street - she can go and stay
with her sister. Doctor’s orders.
SHERLOCK
Don’t be absurd.
JOHN
She’s in shock, for God’s sake! And
all for that bloody stupid cameraphone - where is it anyway?
SHERLOCK
In the safest place I know.
He goes to Mrs. Hudson, puts out his hand - and she pulls the
leopard skin CAMERA-PHONE from inside her blouse and hands it
to him.
MRS HUDSON
You left it in the pocket of your
second best dressing gown, you
clot. Managed to sneak it out when
they thought I was having a cry.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
81.
SHERLOCK
Thank you.
(Tosses the camera-phone
in his hand, slips it in
his pocket)
Shame on you, John Watson.
JOHN
... Shame on me?
SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson? Leave Baker Street??
He puts his arms round her, gives her the biggest hug.
SHERLOCK
England would fall.
112 INT. SHERLOCK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 112
On MRS HUDSON, peacefully asleep in Sherlock’s bed. We pan
from her to bedside digital clock.
11.59.
113 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 113
John slumped in one of the armchairs. The door bangs,
Sherlock now entering. He’s been out somewhere.
JOHN
So where is it now?
SHERLOCK
Where no one will look.
JOHN
Whatever’s in that camera, it’s
more than just pictures.
SHERLOCK
Yes, it is.
He’s crossed to the window, now looking out at the night. He
picks it up his violin, toying with it, thoughtfully.
JOHN
So. She’s alive then. How are we
feeling about that?
And from outside, there are cheers, and fireworks going off.
SHERLOCK
Happy New Year, John.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
82.
JOHN
Do you think you’ll be ... seeing
her again?
Sherlock just looks at him - he overheard that conversation
and they both know it. But he doesn’t answer the question -
or maybe he does. Still looking at John, he tucks the violin
under his chin, and starts to play.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And days of old lang syne!
As Sherlock plays he’s turned to the window. Looking out, he
has just the faintest of smiles.
114 EXT. LONDON STREETS/OUTSIDE PUB - NIGHT 114
The same song is being taken up in a pub - from outside we
can hear the revellers singing, as a caped, hooded figure
heads quickly past.
Closer: IRENE ADLER, heading who knows where...
She stops, hearing a chime. Pulls out her phone - and stares
in surprise at it.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Happy New Year. SH.
She smiles - incredulous, maybe a bit thrilled - then heads
on.
DISSOLVE TO:
115 EXT. LONDON STREETS/OUTSIDE - DAY 115
The same street - but now it’s a blazing hot day. People in
shorts and tee-shirts, ice cream vans. Summer has arrived.
116 EXT. BARTS - DAY 116
Establisher of Barts.
117 INT. BARTS LAB - DAY 117
SHERLOCK is working in Barts lab, Molly assisting.
Sherlock is working at an X- ray machine. On the screen we
can see Irene’s camera-phone, its workings exposed.
MOLLY
Is that a phone?
SHERLOCK
A camera-phone.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
83.
MOLLY
And you’re X-raying it?
SHERLOCK
Yes, I am.
Sherlock now examining the X-Rayed phone - close on some
details several black shapes, positioned around the phone’s
workings. What are those?
MOLLY
Whose phone is it?
SHERLOCK
A woman’s.
MOLLY
(Instant pang)
Your girlfriend?
SHERLOCK
You think she’s my girlfriend
because I’m X-raying her
possessions?
MOLLY
(A slightly guilty
startle)
We all do silly things!
She scuttles away, not able to meet his eye
-- but that idea seems to impact on Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Yes! They do, dont they -
very silly.
He’s pulled the camera-phone from inside the X-Ray -
SHERLOCK
She sent this to my address - and
she loves to play games.
MOLLY
(instantly worried)
She does?
Ignoring her, he’s typing in a new attempt at the entry code.
I AM

Sherlock’s face: damn!
119A INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 119A
On SHERLOCK - just arrived home, now tensing. Something’s
wrong. Looks around, scanning.
Sherlock’s POV. The kitchen - everything seems normal.
Except ...
Sherlock vision: zooming in the window. It’s slightly open.
The glass in front of the catch has been discreetly broken.
Someone’s got in.
He sniffs now.
FLASHBACK: Irene’s red lips.
He now walks quickly to his bedroom, throws open the door.
119B INT. SHERLOCK’S BEDROOM - DAY 119B
IRENE ADLER is fast asleep in his bed. She looks tousled, her
face dirt-streaked. She’s been living rough.
On Sherlock’s face: we can read nothing. From off we hear
JOHN arriving.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
84A.
JOHN
(From off)
Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
We have a client.
JOHN
(From off)
What, in your bedroom.
He joins Sherlock in the doorway. Sees who it is.
JOHN
Oh.
132 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 132
IRENE - showered now, in one of Sherlock’s dressing gowns -
is curled in Sherlock’s armchair, sipping some tea.
SHERLOCK and JOHN are with her.
SHERLOCK
Who’s after you?
IRENE ADLER
People who want to kill me.
SHERLOCK
And who’s that?
IRENE ADLER
Killers.
JOHN
Would help if you were a tiny bit
more specific.
SHERLOCK
So you faked your death to keep
ahead of them.
IRENE ADLER
It worked for a while.
SHERLOCK
Expect you told John you were alive
- and therefore, told me.
IRENE ADLER
I knew you’d keep my secret.
SHERLOCK
You couldn’t.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
85.
IRENE ADLER
But you did, didn’t you?
(A teasing smile - then)
Where’s my camera-phone?
JOHN
Not here, we’re not stupid.
IRENE ADLER
Then what you done with it? If
they’ve guessed you’ve got it,
they’ll have been watching you.
SHERLOCK
If they’ve been watching me,
they’ll know I took a safety
deposit box at a bank on the
Strand, a few months ago.
IRENE ADLER
I need it.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
85A.
JOHN
Okay, but we can’t just go and get
it, can we?
(To Sherlock)
Molly Hooper? She could pick it up,
take it to Barts. One of your
homeless network, could bring it
here, leave it in the cafe. One of
the guys could bring it up the
back.
SHERLOCK
Very good, John - an excellent
plan, full of intelligent
precautions.
JOHN
Thankyou, why don’t I get straight
on to -
But Sherlock has pulled the camera-phone from his pocket.
JOHN
... okay.
133 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 133
On the leopard skin CAMERA PHONE. Sherlock, in his armchair,
has it in his hand, is examining it.
SHERLOCK
So what do you keep on here. In
general, I mean.
IRENE ADLER
Pictures. Information. Anything I
might find useful.
JOHN
For blackmail?
IRENE ADLER
For protection. I make my way in
the world. I misbehave. I like to
know there will be people on my
side - exactly when I need them to
be.
SHERLOCK
And how do you acquire this
information?
IRENE ADLER
I told you - I misbehave.
SHERLOCK
But you’ve acquired something that
is more danger, than protection. Do
you know what it is.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
86.
IRENE ADLER
Yes. But I don’t understand it.
SHERLOCK
I assumed. Show me.
She puts her hand out for the phone - Sherlock affects to
ignore that.
SHERLOCK
What’s the passcode?
One hand with the other, and enters the code -
- and now frowns.
IRENE ADLER
It’s not working.
Sherlock is already lifting camera-phone from her hand.
SHERLOCK
That’s because it’s a duplicate I
had made.
(Checking the display)
Into which you just entered the
number 1058. Funny, I thought you’d
choose something more specific.
He tosses the duplicate aside and produces the real leopard
skin camera phone from behind a book on the shelf.
SHERLOCK
But thanks anyway.
He punches in the number.
On the screen.
It’s flashing again.
WRONG PASSCODE
0 MORE ATTEMPTS
He blinks in confusion - looks to Irene, who is smirking at
him.
IRENE ADLER
It told you that camera phone is my
life. I know when it’s in my hand.
He passes it to her.
SHERLOCK
You’re rather good.
IRENE ADLER
You’re not so bad.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
87.
JOHN
Hamish.
They look at him.
JOHN
Johh Hamish Watson. Just if you’re
looking for kids names.
IRENE ADLER
There was a man - an MOD official -
and I knew what he liked. One of
the things he liked was showing
off.
Passes the phone to Sherlock. A photograph of a computer
screen - on it we can see an email.
IRENE ADLER
He told me this email was going to
save the world. He didn’t know I
photographed it - he was a bit tied
up at the time.
On the screen. The email is headed:
007 CONFIRMED ALLOCATION
And the content of the email is as follows.
4C12C45F13E13G60A60B61F34I34J60D12H33K34K
Sherlock takes the camera-phone to his desk, examines now
bends over it, like he’s trying to drink in every detail.
IRENE ADLER
It’s a bit small on that screen -
can you read it?
SHERLOCK
Yes.
IRENE ADLER
Code obviously. I had one of the
top cryptographers in the country
have a go at this - though he was
mostly upside down at the time!
Couldn’t make anything of it. What
can you do, Mr. Holmes?
She’s at his shoulder now, leaning into him, flirty.
IRENE ADLER
Go on - impress a girl!
And impulsively she leans in to kiss his cheek -
- and time slows down!
On Irene, leaning in - glacier speed.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
88.
Oh John, setting down his teacup - barel moving.
On Sherlock - he alone is normal speed, twitching, thinking,
brain on hyperdrive.
The code from the email now swirls on the screen in front of
him -
4C12C45F13E13G60A60B61F34I34J60D12H
- the letters and numbers spin and dance and re-arrange.
- on Irene’s lips moving closer, so very slowly -
- on John’s teacup, with maddening slowness, descending to
the saucer -
Sherlock blinking, thinking, frowning, come on, come on!!
The letters swirling re-arranging, now in their original
line. (The following is fast, we don’t hang around - this
will take a while to read but should be fluid and zippy on
screen.)
First we see the original line:
4C12C45F13E13G60A60B61F34I34J60D12H
Then all the letters fade out leaving us with.
4 12 45 13 13 60 60 61 34 34 60 12
Then the letters return and the numbers fade leaving us with.
C C F E G A B F I J D H
Sherlock blink, noticing something
The letters rearrange into alphaetical order:
A B C C D E F F G H I J
Now the duplicate letters disappear to become
A B C D E F G H I J
Frowning, recognising, seen that before.
Irene’s lips, closer.
John’s teacup descending.
Now the letters all move slightly, some compressing, some
spreading out to become.
ABC DEFG HIJ
Now boxes form around the letters, and we’re zooming out to
see -
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
89.
- the seating plan of the coach section of a passenger jet.
Now seat row numbers are appearing next to the rows of
letters, and we’re streaking down the schematic to the back
row - numbered as always 55.
And Sherlock just smiles at that.
And the kiss lands, and teacup chinks into the saucer, and
Sherlock says:
SHERLOCK
There’s a margin for error, but I’m
pretty sure there’s a 747 leaving
Heathrow at 6.30 tomorrow evening
for Baltimore, and apparently it’s
going to save the world. Not sure
how that could be true, but give me
a moment, I’ve only been on the
case for eight seconds.
They just look at him, startled.
SHERLOCK
Oh, come on, it’s not code, these
are seat allocations on a passenger
jet. Look! There are no letters
past J - the width of the plane is
the limit. The numbers only appear
singly and never in sequence, but
the letters have little runs of
sequence all over place - families
and couples sitting together. Only
a Jumbo is wide enough to need a
letter J, or rows past 55, which
always require an upstairs section.
There’s a row 13, so we can
eliminate the more superstitious
airlines. The style of the flight
number - zero zero seven -
eliminates a few more, and assuming
a British point of origin, which
would be logical given the original
source of the information, and
assuming from the increased
pressure on you lately, that the
crisis is imminent, the only flight
which matches all the criteria and
departs within a week, is the 6.30
to Baltimore tomorrow evening, from
Heathrow airport.
Again just silence. That was alarming fast and clever. For
the first time, Irene is just staring at him in a general
state of wow!
SHERLOCK
Please don’t feel obliged to tell
me that was remarkable or amazing.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
90.
(MORE)
John has expressed that thought in
every possible variant available to
the English language.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
90A.
SHERLOCK (cont'd)
IRENE ADLER
I would have you, on this desk,
right now, till you begged for
mercy, twice.
SHERLOCK
............. John, could you check
those flight schedules, see if I’m
right?
JOHN
... yeah, right, on it, yeah.
He potters at a computer. Grateful to be out of the
conversation.
Sherlock looks back at Irene, still that roasting stare from
a bit too close. He makes a modest flail for dignity.
SHERLOCK
Never begged for mercy in my life.
IRENE ADLER
Twice.
JOHN
Yep, you’re right - double-O-seven,
licensed to fly.
On Sherlock - the words impact on him.
SHERLOCK
What did you say??
JOHN
I said, you’re right.
SHERLOCK
No, after that, what did you say
after that??
JOHN
Double-O-seven. Flight double-Oseven.
Sherlock distracted now, moving away - something haunting
him, chiming in his head.
On Irene, watching him, apparently worried -
- but the camera swoops down behind her, closing on one hand
held slightly behind her. She has her phone in her hand and
is rapidly thumbing a text.
The words now running across the screen:
747 TOMORROW 6.30PM. HEATHROW.
The words keep typing as the picture behind them dissolves
to:
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
91.
134 EXT. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - DAY 134
From behind, a MAN heading along. As the words complete,
there is the beep of a text arriving. The man stops walking,
pulls out his mobile phone, looks at it -
- and as he does so, we swoop round in front of him. It’s JIM
MORIARTY! He reads the text in mounting joy. A mad,
spreading, grin.
135 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 135
On Sherlock, pacing now, bit frantic, trying to reach for
something
SHERLOCK
Double-O-seven! Double-O-seven.
(Slaps his head)
There’s something! What? What??
136 EXT. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - DAY 136
JIM MORIARTY, rapidly texting away.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me.
As Jim, he giggles happily, childishly. He glances up a Big
Ben and the House of Commons - and blows a big raspberry.
137 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 137
Sherlock still pacing, still frantic.
SHERLOCK
Licensed to fly, license to -
Then it hits him like a physical impact.
FLASHBACK: Mycroft on the phone, in this very flat.
MYCROFT
(Repeating, on a loop)
Bond Air is go, Bond Air is go,
Bond Air is go, Bond Air is go ...
Tracking in on Sherlock’s bemused face. What? What??
138 INT. MYCROFT’S STUDY - DAY 138
A blackberry on a leather-topped desk. It buzzes, a text
arriving. A hand reaches in, picks it up to read.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me.
And the camera moves to reveal -
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
92.
- Mycroft staring at the text in mounting horror.
We’re pulling back from now, a smaller and smaller figure.
He’s just received the worst news in the world. Dissolve to:
The same pulling back shot, but now Mycroft is sitting in his
leather armchair, stricken-faced, a brandy in his hand.
Dissolve to:
The same pulling back shot. Mycroft, sitting in the chair,
his head held in his hands. How the hell is he going to deal
with this one.
139 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT 139
SHERLOCK sprawled in his armchair, plucking listlessly at his
violin - the same sad tune he composed earlier, but he’s
probably unaware of that. Deep, deep, in thought.
Flashback.
MYCROFT
Bond Air is go, that’s decided -
check with the Coventry lot. Talk
later.
Sherlock frowning, distracted. Blinks, rewinds.
MYCROFT
Coventry - Coventry - Coventry -
Coventry -
Wider shot. Someone’s POV, as Sherlock cogitates.
On IRENE leaning in the kitchen doorway, watching him. Her
face: so sad. For the first time, she looks full of regrets.
SHERLOCK
Coventry.
IRENE ADLER
Never been, is it nice?
Sherlock looks up a little startled.
SHERLOCK
Where’s John?
IRENE ADLER
He went out - couple of hours ago.
SHERLOCK
But I was just talking to him.
IRENE ADLER
He said you’d do that. What’s
Coventry got to do with anything?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
93.
SHERLOCK
There’s a story - possibly not
true. In the second world war, the
allies knew Coventry was going to
be bombed - because they’d broken
the Germans code. But they didn’t
want the Germans to know they’d
broken it, so they let the bombing
happen away...
IRENE ADLER
Have you ever had anyone?
SHERLOCK
... I’m sorry?
IRENE ADLER
And when I say “had”, I’m being
indelicate.
SHERLOCK
I don’t understand.
IRENE ADLER
I’ll be delicate then. Let’s have
dinner.
SHERLOCK
Why?
IRENE ADLER
You might be hungry.
SHERLOCK
I’m not.
IRENE ADLER
Good.
She’s kneeling by him now, taking his hand. (We note that he
seems to reciprocate slightly, but a little clumsily.)
SHERLOCK
Why would I want to have dinner, if
I wasn’t hungry?
She’s leaning in close to him - studying his face, hungrily.
He’s equally fascinated, maybe a bit more forensic.
IRENE ADLER
Mr. Holmes ... if it was end of the
world, if this was the very last
night ... would you have dinner
with me?
On Sherlock, puzzled. Then there’s a knock at the door.
MRS HUDSON
(From off)
Sherlock?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
94.
IRENE ADLER
Too late.
SHERLOCK
That’s not the end of the world,
that’s Mrs Hudson.
She gives the saddest look, like she knows he’s wrong, and
moves away from him.
The door is opening - MRS HUDSON. Behind her we can see
PLUMMER - the man who first took Sherlock to Buckingham
Palace.
MRS HUDSON
Sherlock, this man was at the door -
is the bell still not working?
(To PLUMMER)
He shot it.
Plummer is already entering the room.
SHERLOCK
Are you taking me away again.
PLUMMER
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
I decline.
PLUMMER
I don’t think you do.
And Plummer has taken a long envelope from inside his jacket,
now passes it to Sherlock.
A puzzled Sherlock slits it open - and falling into his hand
is -
- a boarding pass. Flight 007 to BALTIMORE, 18.30.
He stares at it. What??
140 EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT 140
SHERLOCK again climbing into the back of a big black car -
PLUMMER now climbing in next to him.
The car starts to pull away. We pan up to IRENE ADLER,
standing at the window, watching it go...
141 INT. BIG BLACK CAR - NIGHT 141
PLUMMER and SHERLOCK in the back. The street lights flashing
across their faces. A silence. Then.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
95.
SHERLOCK
There’s going to be a bomb on a
passenger jet. And the British and
American governments know about it.
And rather than expose the source
of their information they’re going
to let the plane blow up. Coventry
all over again. The wheel turns,
nothing is ever new.
PLUMMER
... I read that blog your friend
writes about you.
SHERLOCK
And?
PLUMMER
And I didn’t expect you to be an
idiot.
Silence resumes. Sherlock - just the trace of a frown.
Something’s not good here.
Sherlock’s POV. Lights and signs speeding past - we’re
turning towards HEATHROW.
142 EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 142
We’re on a remote part of the airfield. A JUMBO JET standing
by a HANGER. The passenger staircase is in place.
The BIG BLACK CAR goes gliding up. Stops next to it. As
Sherlock climbs out he sees -
NEILSON and his TWO AMERICAN AGENTS standing at the foot of
the steps, like they’re there to guide him on to the plane.
Sherlock, walking over to them now.
SHERLOCK
(To NEILSON)
Well you’re looking all better. How
are you feeling?
NEILSON
Like putting a bullet in your
brain, sir.
He gestures to the steps, for Sherlock to ascend. Sherlock
starts heading up.
NEILSON
They’d pin a medal on me, if I did.
Sir.
Sherlock just stops for a moment, registering that. Then
carries on up the steps.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
96.
143 INT. JUMBO - NIGHT 143
Sherlock, looking around.
The interior of the plane is darkened, creepy. The only light
from the portholes.
As Sherlock’s eyes adjust to the gloom, he realises he’s not
alone ...
... all the seats are occupied. Still, motionless figures,
sitting and slumped. Sherlock steps closer to one of them -
clicks on the overhead light. And there, in the little
spotlight, is a a DEAD MAN.
He clicks on another light. A DEAD WOMAN.
Another light. Yet another DEAD PASSENGER.
On Sherlock: even for him, a neck-prickling realisation.
Everyone on this plane dead. A passenger manifest of corpses.
And then, impossible - a light nearer the front of the plane
seems to click on by itself. And there’s a familiar voice.
MYCROFT
The Coventry conundrum. What do you
think of my solution?
And now a figure is rising from one the front seats, turn to
face him. Mycroft.
MYCROFT
The flight of the dead.
Sherlock, looking around, collecting himself, regaining his
cool.
SHERLOCK
The plane blows up in mid-air,
mission accomplished for the
terrorists, hundreds of casualties
... and nobody dies.
MYCROFT
Neat, don’t you think? You’ve been
stumbling round the fringes of this
one for ages - or were you too
bored to notice the pattern.
On Sherlock blinking, remembering
FLASHBACK: The big, beefy creepy guy, holding his Aunt’s urn.
CREEPY GUY
I know human ash!
FLASHBACK: The two little girls squeezed into the client
chair.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
97.
LITTLE GIRL
They wouldn’t let us see Grandad
when he was dead -
Back on the plane:
MYCROFT
We ran a similar project with the
Germans a while back - though I
understand one of our passengers
didn’t make the flight - ...
FLASHBACK: Sherlock examining the inexplicable body in the
boot of the car.
MYCROFT
But that’s the deceased for you -
late in every sense of the word.
SHERLOCK
How does the plane fly? Of course,
unmanned aircraft, hardly new -
MYCROFT
It doesn’t fly, it will never fly.
This entire project is cancelled.
The terrorist cells have been
informed that we know about the
bomb - we can’t fool them now. We
have lost everything. One fragment
of one email - and months and years
of planning are finished.
SHERLOCK
Your MOD man...
MYCROFT
That’s all it takes. One lonely,
naive man, desperate to show off,
and a woman clever enough to make
him feel special ...
SHERLOCK
You should screen your defence
people more carefully ...
MYCROFT
I’m not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I’m talking about you!
On Sherlock. Rocked by that. No.
MYCROFT
A damsel in distress. In the end,
are you really so obvious, because
this was textbook! The promise of
love, the pain of loss, the joy of
redemption. Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance...
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
98.
SHERLOCK
Don’t be absurd!
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
98A.
MYCROFT
Absurd? How quickly did you
decipher that email for her - the
full minute, or were you really
trying to impress?
IRENE ADLER
(From)
I think it was less than five
seconds.
Sherlock looks round. There’s IRENE, by the entrance to first
class. NEILSON stands behind her, clearly has just shown her
up. She’s back in her own clothes - never looked more ice
queen. The armour’s back on..
Sherlock staring at her - guarded, unsure. Mycroft, genuinely
penitent.
MYCROFT
And I drove you into her path. I’m
sorry, I didn’t know.
IRENE ADLER
Mr. Holmes, I think we need to
talk.
Sherlock, now striding towards her. Casual and assured now,
back to his old stuff.
SHERLOCK
I think so too. There are a number
of aspects I’m still not completely
clear on -
IRENE ADLER
Not you, junior, you’re done now.
And she simply walks past him, goes to Mycroft. She produces
her leopard skin camera-phone, tosses it in her hand.
IRENE ADLER
There’s more - loads more. And if
you like, I’ll keep on proving
that. You have no idea how much
havoc I can cause, and exactly one
way to stop me.
On Mycroft. No answer. Because she’s right.
145 INT. MYCROFT’S STUDY - NIGHT 145
MYCROFT at his desk. On the table in front of him, the
leopard skin camera-phone. Opposite is IRENE. Standing with
his back to them both, SHERLOCK looking out into the night -
a brooding, silent presence.
Mycroft prods the phone with his finger.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
99.
MYCROFT
We have people who can get into
this.
IRENE ADLER
I tested that theory for you - I
let Sherlock Holmes try for six
months. Sherlock, dear, tell him
what you found when you X-rayed my
camera-phone.
Sherlock doesn’t turn, just speaks from where he’s standing.
SHERLOCK
There are four additional units
wired into the casing - I suspect
containing acid or a small amount
of explosive. Any attempt to open
the casing, will burn the hard
drive.
IRENE ADLER
Explosive. It’s more me.
MYCROFT
Some data is always recoverable.
IRENE ADLER
Take that risk then.
MYCROFT
... you have a passcode to open
this. I deeply regret to say, we
have people who can extract it from
you.
IRENE ADLER
Sherlock?
*
SHERLOCK
There will be two codes. One to
open the phone, one to burn the
drive. Even under duress, you can’t
know which one she’s given you. And
there would be no point in a second
attempt.
IRENE ADLER
Oh, isn’t he good. I should have
him on a leash. In fact, I might.
MYCROFT
We destroy this then. No one has
the information.
IRENE ADLER
Fine, good idea. Unless there are
lives of British citizens depending
on the information you’re about to
burn.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
100.
MYCROFT
Are there?
IRENE ADLER
Telling you, would be playing fair.
I’m not playing any more.
She’s tossed him an envelope across the desk to Mycroft.
IRENE ADLER
A list of requests, and some ideas
about my protection once they’re
granted.
Mycroft has slit open the envelope, glanced at the single
sheet.
IRENE ADLER
I’d say it wouldn’t blow much of a
hole in the wealth of a nation, but
I’d be lying. I imagine you’d like
to sleep on it.
MYCROFT
Thank you, yes.
IRENE ADLER
Too bad. Off you pop and talk to
people.
He looks at her. A grim moment - total defeat. A polite
little bow of his head.
MYCROFT
You’ve been very ... thorough. I
wish our lot were half as good as
you.
IRENE ADLER
Can’t take all the credit. Got a
bit of help. Jim Moriarty sends his
love.
On Sherlock’s back - stiffening.
On Mycroft, a sober note.
MYCROFT
Yes, he’s been in touch. He seems
to be desperate for my attention.
(Makes a note)
Which I’m sure can be arranged.
IRENE ADLER
I had all this stuff, never really
knew what to do with it. Thank God,
for the consultant criminal.
Gave me lots of advice on how to
play the Holmes boys. Do you know
what he calls you - the Ice Man.
And the Virgin.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
101.
On Sherlock again. Still not turning, still not rising to it.
IRENE ADLER
Didn’t even ask for anything. I
think he just likes to cause
trouble. Now that’s my kind of man.
MYCROFT
And here you are. The dominatrix
who brought a nation to its knees.
Nicely played.
He starts to stand, but -
SHERLOCK
(Still without turning)
No.
IRENE ADLER
I’m sorry?
Sherlock, turning now. Quite his old self, cold as ice.
SHERLOCK
I said, no. Very, very close, but
no. You got carried away, the game
was far too elaborate - you enjoyed
yourself too much.
IRENE ADLER
There’s no such thing as too much.
SHERLOCK
Enjoying thrill of the chase is
fine. Craving the distraction of
the game - I entirely sympathise.
But sentiment? Sentiment is a
chemical defect found in the losing
side.
IRENE ADLER
Sentiment? What are you talking
about?
SHERLOCK
You.
IRENE ADLER
Oh dear God, look at the poor man.
You don’t think I was actually
interested in you? Why? Because
you’re the great Sherlock Holmes?
The clever detective with the funny
hat?
SHERLOCK
No. Because I took your pulse.
FLASHBACK: in 221B, Irene taking Sherlock’s hand, Sherlock
clumsily reciprocating - but actually taking her pulse.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
102.
SHERLOCK
Elevated. Your pupils dilated.
FLASHBACK: Irene studying his face hungrily. Sherlock
staring, back forensic. Closer now on her dilating pupil.
SHERLOCK
I imagine John Watson thinks love
is a mystery to me. But the
chemistry is terribly simple. And
very destructive.
He’s walking round the desk - in swanning about, explaining
mode. He picks up her camera-phone.
On Irene - just the first uncertainty. Is she in trouble now?
SHERLOCK
You told me, when we first met,
that disguise is always a selfportrait. How true of you. The
combination of your safe - your
measurements. But this -
(Tosses the camera-phone
in his hand)
This is more intimate. It’s your
heart. And you should never let it
rule your head.
(Presses one key. A beep)
You could have chosen any random
number and you’d have walked away
today, with everything you worked
for.
(Another key - beep)
But you couldn’t resist it, could
you? I’ve always assumed that love
was a dangerous disadvantage -
(Beep)
Thank you for the final proof.
He holds the phone out to her, displaying the screen.
Irene, rocked already, just stares at it. Everything is lost.
Maybe there’s even a tear in her eye, as she looks up at him.
IRENE ADLER
Everything I said tonight - it
wasn’t real. It was just playing
the game.
SHERLOCK
I know. And this is just losing.
The final beep. And now we see the fully entered code.
Letters not numbers, and the screen now reads:
I AM
[S] [H] [E] [R]
LOCKED
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
103.
The screen flashes, folds out into menu displays.
SHERLOCK
And so you are.
He tosses it to Mycroft.
SHERLOCK
There you go, brother. I hope the
contents make up for any
inconvenience I’ve caused you this
evening.
Mycroft, bemusedly staring at the phone. He’s pleased at the
victory, but just a little chilled at how Sherlock won.
MYCROFT
I’m certain they will...
SHERLOCK
If you’re feeling kind, lock her
up. If not, let her go. I doubt
she’ll last long without her
protection.
IRENE ADLER
Are you expecting me to beg?
SHERLOCK
Yes.
He turns, heading to the door, almost gets there -
IRENE ADLER
Please.
He looks round. She’s standing now - so vulnerable. Pleading.
IRENE ADLER
You’re right. I won’t last six
months. Please.
Pushing in Sherlock now - that cold, cruel face.
SHERLOCK
Sorry about dinner.
And he goes, closing the door behind him. And slowly we fade
to black.
146 EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY 146
It’s winter again - and raining like hell: a day for terrible
news. JOHN is dashing along through the downpour. He stops as
he sees an unfamiliar sight.
MYCROFT, leaning against the wall, outside Speedy’s. He’s
under shelter of the awning and smoking. He has big ziplock
file under his arm. John approaches.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
104.
JOHN
You don’t smoke.
MYCROFT
I also don’t frequent cafes.
He turns and heads into Speedy’s, clearly expecting John to
follow.
147 INT. SPEEDY’S CAFE - DAY 147
MYCROFT and JOHN, sitting across the table from each other,
with coffees. Silence for a moment - just the hiss of the
rain outside, the under-sea gloom of the cafe, the soaking
wet coats of the customers.
John’s eyes go to:
The zip-lock file on the table. Through the transparent cover
he can see a sheaf of papers, and the leopard skin cameraphone.
JOHN
The file on Irene Adler.
MYCROFT
Closed for ever. I’m about to go
and inform my brother - or, if you
prefer, you are - that she somehow
got herself into a witness
protection scheme in America. New
name, new identity. She will
survive and thrive - but he will
never see her again.
JOHN
Why would he care?
Mycroft just looks at him. Oh, come now.
JOHN
He despised her at the end. He
won’t even mention her by name -
just “the woman.”
MYCROFT
Is that loathing, or a salute? One
of a kind, the one woman who
matters?
JOHN
He’s not like that. He doesn’t feel
things that way. I don’t think ...
MYCROFT
My brother has the brain of
scientist, or a philosopher. Yet he
elects to be a detective. What
might we deduce about his heart?
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
105.
JOHN
I don’t know.
MYCROFT
Neither do I. But initially he
wanted to be a pirate.
JOHN
He’ll be okay with this. Witness
protection, never seeing her again,
he’ll be fine.
MYCROFT
I agree. That’s why I decided to
tell him that.
John looks at Mycroft. Something new in the room now. What
does he mean?
JOHN
... instead of what?
MYCROFT
She’s dead. She was captured by a
terrorist cell in Islamabad two
months ago, and beheaded.
A silence between them. Oh.
JOHN
Definitely her? She’s done this
before...
MYCROFT
I was thorough this time. It would
take Sherlock Holmes to fool me,
and I don’t think he was on hand,
do you?
Another silence. Oh God.
MYCROFT
So.
(Pushes the file over to
John)
What shall we tell Sherlock?
148 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 148
SHERLOCK at the kitchen table. He’s at his microscope
studying something.
On John. He’s hesitating a few feet away. He has the file in
his hand.
The rain is streaming down the windows, casting shadowpatterns all over the walls. The little flat has never looked
so gloomy.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
106.
SHERLOCK
(Without looking up)
Clearly you have news. If it’s
about that triple murder in Leeds,
it was the gardener. Did nobody
notice his earring?
JOHN
Hi. No, it’s ... it’s about Irene
Adler.
And Sherlock looks up, instantly interested.
On John, registering this.
SHERLOCK
Well? Has something happened? Has
she turned up again?
JOHN
No. No, she’s ... I just bumped
into Mycroft downstairs, he had to
take a call ...
SHERLOCK
Is she back in London?
And he’s on his feet. He’s come over to John. He’s just that
little bit too interested.
JOHN
No. She’s ...
And he’s looking hard at Sherlock. And Sherlock is looking a
bit too hard at him. And John makes the fateful decision.
JOHN
She’s in America.
SHERLOCK
America?
JOHN
Yeah. She’s gone into a witness
protection scheme, apparently.
Don’t know how she swung it. But,
you know ...
SHERLOCK
I know what?
JOHN
Well. You won’t able to see her
again.
SHERLOCK
Why would I want to see her again?
JOHN
Didn’t say you did.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
107.
SHERLOCK
Is that her file?
JOHN
Yeah - got to take it back to
Mycroft. Do you ... want a look at
it?
SHERLOCK
No.
Sherlock has gone back to his microscope.
Oh John: has he misjudged. Should he have told him,
JOHN
Listen. Actually -
SHERLOCK
(Without looking up)
Oh, but I’ll have the camera-phone.
He puts his hand out for it.
JOHN
There’s nothing on it any more. It
was all stripped off.
SHERLOCK
I know. But I’ll have it.
JOHN
No, it has to go back to Mycroft.
You can’t keep this.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, or even look at him. Just continues
to hold his hand out.
JOHN
Sherlock, I have to take this back.
It’s government property now, it’s -
SHERLOCK
Please.
Still hasn’t looked round, still hasn’t registered any
emotion.
John: what the hell does he do. He steps over, hands him the
camera-phone. Sherlock pockets it.
SHERLOCK
Thank you.
John, now hesitating to the door.
JOHN
Better take this back down.
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
108.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
John, at the door, turns.
JOHN
Did she ever text you again? After
... all that?
SHERLOCK
Once. A couple of months ago.
JOHN
What did she say?
SHERLOCK
Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.
On John. Considers that for a moment - probably the last day
of her life. He heads out.
We stay on Sherlock. Sits back from the microscope. Then
stands, crossing to the window. He’s got his phone out, is
scrolling through some old texts.
Closer on the phone. Under the heading The Woman, all her
texts. The last one
GOOD-BYE MR. HOLMES.
On this we dissolve to:
149 INT. GROTTY LITTLE ROOM/ISLAMABAD - DAY 149
IRENE, on her last day, kneeling in the centre of a room,
surrounded by MASKED AND ROBED TERRORISTS.
Irene is calm, serene - and sending one last text. She now
hands her phone to one of the terrorists, and we see her say
“Thankyou”. Her EXECUTIONER is stepping up behind her now,
swinging back with his long sword.
Closer on Irene now, as she straightens her neck and prepares
herself for the end. So sad, so full of regrets. She slowly
closes her eyes.
And as her eyes close, the screen fades into darkness.
We hold the darkness for a long final moment, like the movie
really is over. Then:
An ORGASMIC GASP. A text has arrived!
On Irene as her eyes fly open again. What? Where did that
come from??
The terrorists all looking at each other now. What??
A Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages - 25/07/2011
109.
But Irene is looking up at her tall, thin executioner. The
face is covered but the voice is familiar.
SHERLOCK
When I say run, run!
On Irene - her face breaks into a delighted, incredulous
grin.
150 INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 150
And now the same grin on Sherlock’s face, remembering that
day. He laughs! Fooled them all again! He pulls the leopard
skin camera-phone from his pocket, tosses it in his hand.
SHERLOCK
(As a sort of salute)
The Woman!
He takes the camera-phone, opens his desk drawer, drops it
inside. Looks at it lying there for moment.
SHERLOCK
(More fondly)
The Woman.
On his face, clear moment of warmth - remembering the long
contest, that remarkable woman, the year of Irene Adler.
Then he closes the drawer. It’s almost ceremonial - like he’s
putting something away. Then the warmth just drops from his
face, and he’s Sherlock Holmes again.
We hold the closed drawer big in the foreground as he turns
and walks away - back to his microscope, back to work...
